//! The exporter as the scanout pipeline sees it.
//!
//! Split from `discovery.rs`, which owns the exporter's state and the long
//! export procedure itself. What lives here is the trait boundary: the
//! episode bookkeeping the pipeline drives, and the timing wrapper that
//! files each export under the path it actually took.
//!
//! Kept apart because the procedure and the boundary change for different
//! reasons -- one when the fallback ladder does, the other when the pipeline
//! asks the exporter something new.

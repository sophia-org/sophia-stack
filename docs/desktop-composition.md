# Choose what starts with your desktop

Your desktop is a collection of parts you choose. You might use one project's
window manager, another project's panel, and a small shell for your window
switcher. Sophia starts those parts and keeps their responsibilities separate.

Put those choices in `~/.config/sophia/desktop.kdl`. If you set
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, use its `sophia/desktop.kdl` instead. This is the existing
desktop profile, now with a home that belongs to the whole session.

## Choose the parts

The `session` section selects your window manager, native shell, and login
applications. For an installed Hagia desktop, the choices can look like this:

```kdl
session {
    window-manager "/opt/sophia/current/target/release/hagia"
    shell-client "/opt/sophia/current/target/release/narthex"
    shell-config "/home/alex/.config/narthex/config.kdl"
    terminal "terminal"
    browser "browser"
    startup "terminal" "quickshell-panel"
}
```

This is one section of a complete profile. Keep its `schema 1`, policy,
shortcuts, and other authority sections. Replace the example paths with yours.
For Hagia's replaceable development binary, use the absolute path to
`~/.local/state/sophia/bin/hagia`.

Executable and configuration paths must be absolute. Sophia does not expand
`~`, substitute environment variables, or run a command through a shell.
`window-manager` accepts additional string arguments. Native shell clients use
the existing `--serve` entry point. `shell-config` selects a file the session
makes readable inside the shell's protection domain; the shell interprets it.
An explicitly selected file must exist.

The inherited Narthex setup keeps its usual `~/.config/narthex/config.kdl`.
When you explicitly select a shell, also select its private file if it needs
one. A replacement shell does not inherit Narthex's settings.

You may omit these selections to use the launcher's defaults. An explicit
command-line selection wins over the profile. The profile's WM selection wins
over `config.kdl`'s older `external-wm` setting; both win over a launcher default.

The names in `startup` refer to applications registered in Sophia's
`config.kdl` or by the session launcher. Their executable paths and arguments
stay in that registry. Listing an application here grants it no native shell
role. Use `startup` with no arguments to start no applications at login.

## Configure each part where it belongs

The desktop profile answers which parts run and what they may do. Each part
keeps its own settings:

| Change | Where to make it |
| --- | --- |
| Choose a WM, native shell, or login application | Sophia desktop profile, `session` section |
| Enable the native shell or set its reservation allowance | Desktop profile, `shell` section |
| Choose layouts, gaps, and navigation | Your WM's policy configuration |
| Change a panel's widgets or appearance | Your panel's configuration |
| Change shortcut-help startup behavior | Your native shell's configuration |
| Register an application or change its command | Sophia `config.kdl`, application registry |

The profile can carry WM settings in its `policy` section. Sophia passes that
section to the chosen WM for validation. You can keep it in a separate file
and include it using the profile's existing bounded include support. Sophia
does not interpret your WM's layout vocabulary.

Hagia bindings can still request a terminal, browser, or other admitted session
action. The session performs the launch. Choosing a WM does not give it the
ability to start arbitrary host processes or select its own shell permissions.

The `terminal` mapping chooses what the terminal shortcut opens; it does not
require a terminal at login. To start only your panel, keep the mapping and
list only the panel in `startup`:

```kdl
session {
    terminal "terminal"
    startup "quickshell-panel"
}
```

These names refer to your registered applications. Ordinary Hagia login does
not require a focused application window. The focused-frame startup deadline
is reserved for the launcher profiles that explicitly exercise applications.
There is no replacement timeout for opening your first application. Empty and
panel-only desktops remain usable indefinitely, and a failed login application
does not prevent later applications from starting. Sophia still enforces the
deadlines of individual operations, such as a WM response or a pending page flip.

## Keep the panel and helper together

Quickshell and Narthex can run in the same desktop. In the current setup,
Quickshell supplies an X11 panel; Narthex supplies native features such as the
switcher and shortcut helper. Keep `shell { enabled #true; }` for the native
shell and list the panel in `session.startup`.

Sophia currently admits one native shell client. Dividing native responsibilities
among several clients will require explicit role assignment and protocol work.
There is no first-client-wins selection, and an X11 panel does not become the
native shell by appearing in the startup list.

## Choose a shell and its permissions

Today, the native shell uses descriptors. Narthex chooses among the features
Sophia knows how to draw: a switcher, tabs, shortcut help, and the application
launcher. Its own configuration controls the choices and appearance settings
those features support. Changing shells does not change the application's
execution policy or give the WM access to shell metadata.

The proposed content model would let a shell draw its own widgets, typography,
and artwork. Sophia would still control placement, GPU composition, physical
input, and presentation. Such a shell could provide a custom panel while using
the existing descriptor launcher. These are capabilities of the one admitted
native shell, not two native shell processes.

Choosing that shell and permitting custom content would be separate operator
decisions. Under the proposal, content is denied unless the session policy
explicitly grants it at startup. The shell cannot grant itself more permission.
The grant would be recorded with the effective profile. Content support and its
configuration syntax do not exist yet; there is no setting to add to your
current profile to enable it.

The added permission concerns what the shell can show you. A content shell
could imitate a prompt or mislabel a button inside its own space, so you would
need to trust its presentation more. That permission would not let it read other
applications' pixels, capture the desktop, run arbitrary commands, or replace
the lock screen. Those operations have separate authorities. Descriptor
restrictions reduce visual freedom without promising that a shell can never
mislead you.

Your Quickshell X11 panel remains an ordinary application under its existing
application policy. The proposed native-shell restrictions do not retroactively
confine it or grant it the native role. See the
[content-shell proposal](content-shell.md) for the developer contract; X11
compatibility and your current shell selection remain the development priority.

## Understand startup and restart

Login applications start once when the session opens. Reloading the WM or
restarting it does not run that list again. Changing component selections or
the startup list takes effect at your next login. A live profile reload reports
session changes as deferred while applying the settings it can change live.
The running component selections and startup list remain unchanged.

Sophia supervises the native WM and shell through their existing recovery
paths. An application in `startup` uses the ordinary application lifecycle;
it does not acquire automatic restart merely because it is a panel. Keep
services that should outlive the graphical session under your usual service
manager. No particular service manager is required.

## Move an existing profile

An existing `~/.config/hagia/config.kdl` continues to work. When you are ready,
move the complete desktop profile to `~/.config/sophia/desktop.kdl`, preserving
the meaning of any relative include paths. There is no automatic merge of the
two files. Edit the selected file; changes in the other one have no effect.

`config print-effective` can produce a complete profile with includes expanded.
If the destination does not yet exist, this gives you a copy to review while
keeping the old file as a fallback:

```sh
(
    set -eu
    umask 077
    config_home="${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"
    mkdir -p "$config_home/sophia"
    staged="$(mktemp "$config_home/sophia/.desktop.XXXXXX")"
    trap 'rm -f -- "$staged"' EXIT
    sophia config print-effective \
        --desktop-profile="$config_home/hagia/config.kdl" \
        > "$staged"
    sophia config check --desktop-profile="$staged"
    ln -T -- "$staged" "$config_home/sophia/desktop.kdl"
)
```

Run this with the new Sophia build. It validates the copy and refuses to replace
an existing desktop file. Expanded output keeps settings and their order;
comments inside the original authority sections are not retained.

Discovery checks an explicit `--desktop-profile` first, then the user's Sophia
desktop file, the user's legacy Hagia file, `/etc/sophia/desktop.kdl`, and
`/etc/hagia/config.kdl`. The installed launcher falls back to its packaged
profile. Promotion runs retain their exact packaged profile.

Before your next login, check the profile:

```sh
sophia config check --desktop-profile="$HOME/.config/sophia/desktop.kdl"
sophia config print-effective --desktop-profile="$HOME/.config/sophia/desktop.kdl"
```

The first command validates Sophia's sections and the profile structure. The
second shows the parsed choices and their source. WM settings are validated by
the selected WM before the graphical session is admitted. Shell-specific
settings are validated by the shell that reads them.

## Application menus

Choose a named `application-catalog` in the desktop profile and bind
`session:application-launcher` to open it. The core configuration defines the
catalog sources and execution policy; your native shell supplies search and
selection. This adds no launcher process to WM startup. See
[application launcher](application-launcher.md) for the configuration and trust
boundary.

# Data-Oriented Design

**Role:** normative data-boundary design.

Sophia is a set of cooperating processes. The data-oriented rule is simple:
data crosses a boundary as a packet, snapshot, command stream, or typed ID.
Nothing reaches back across the boundary to mutate private state.

This is the same discipline used in Okys, adapted from a graphics library to a
desktop session. Sophia has more processes and stronger security boundaries, so
the rule matters more.

## Core Rule

Separate data from authority.

Protocol authorities own client-protocol authority. Sophia Engine owns visual
and compositor authority. Sophia WM owns policy authority. Portals own
cross-namespace transfer authority.

Each layer exports data about its state, not pointers into its state.

Good:

```text
SurfaceSnapshot {
    surface_id,
    authority_local_id,
    namespace_id,
    geometry,
    damage_region,
    buffer_handle,
    serial,
}
```

Avoid:

```text
Window object shared by Engine, WM, protocol authority, and portal process.
```

A shared object graph would turn process boundaries into fiction. Sophia should
prefer flat records, handles, generations, and immutable snapshots.

## Layers

```text
types      passive records, IDs, enums, flags
state      dense tables owned by one process
protocol   packet definitions and serialization
systems    logic that consumes snapshots and emits new packets
authority  client-protocol translation and protocol resources
bridge     explicitly historical or optional external-authority adaptation
portal     namespace-crossing transfer policy
```

Types do not perform work. State owns storage. Systems transform data. Protocols
move data. Authorities terminate client protocols. Bridges translate legacy or
external authority from one domain to another during prototype work.

## TEA Where It Applies

The Elm Architecture is a good fit for policy processes, not for every part of
Sophia.

Use this shape for Sophia WM and portals:

```text
Model + Event/Snapshot -> update -> Command Packet
```

Examples:

- WM model plus `LayoutNodeSnapshot` values produces a `LayoutTransaction`.
- Portal transfer state plus user or policy events produces allow, deny, revoke,
  or handoff packets.

Do not force Sophia Engine into a global TEA loop. The compositor is the
security and performance authority. It should keep explicit state tables,
generation-checked IDs, spatial indexes, damage queues, frame plans, and
renderer/backend systems. Its public boundaries may still speak in snapshots and
commands, but its inner loops should stay allocation-light, cache-conscious, and
auditable.

[State and Transition Discipline](state-and-transition-discipline.md) explains
the deeper model behind these boundaries. State-Action-Model is only a limited
analogy for proposal, acceptance, and derived output at selected boundaries;
it is not a Sophia protocol and does not replace the explicit data-oriented
Engine transaction path.

## Candidate IDs

Typed IDs prevent one domain's integer from masquerading as another.

- `SurfaceId` for compositor surfaces tracked by Sophia Engine.
- `XWindowId` for authority-private X11 window XIDs where an X-specific adapter
  requires a typed wrapper.
- `NamespaceId` for sandbox labels known to Sophia.
- `OutputId` for physical or virtual outputs.
- `SeatId` and `DeviceId` for input routing.
- `TransactionId` for atomic WM updates.
- `PortalTransferId` for cross-namespace transfers.

IDs should carry generations where stale references are plausible. XIDs are
foreign identifiers and should be wrapped, not reused as Sophia-owned IDs.

## Core Packets

### SessionRuntimeState

Session runtime state is the data-only coordinator for the continuous session
loop.

Fields should describe:

- current runtime phase
- total X events polled
- rendered frame count
- drained portal command count
- presented chrome command count
- WM restart request count
- last rendered frame serial

The reducer may emit commands to poll X, request WM policy, schedule or render a
frame, drain portals, present chrome, or restart the WM. It must not poll file
descriptors, render, or mutate X11 state directly.

`SessionRuntimeLoop` may batch `SessionRuntimeEvent` values and collect emitted
commands, but it must remain a pure data shell around the reducer. External
runtime adapters own blocking I/O, socket reads, X event polling, renderer
work, and process waits; they feed observations into the loop rather than
embedding those operations inside runtime policy.

`SessionRuntimeObservation` is the external adapter boundary. It may represent
only reduced, bounded facts: counts, frame serials, restart/layout readiness,
broker health state, broker health generation, and broker status-message
length. It must not become a generic envelope for raw X events, XIDs, namespace
tokens, metadata strings, portal payload bytes, icon bytes, buffers, or file
paths. `SessionRuntimeEventBatch` enforces the maximum observation count before
the runtime loop sees the events.

Concrete producer adapters may live beside the data they reduce. For example,
Sophia Engine may map WM transaction updates, frame/render reports, portal
commands, and chrome updates into observations because it already owns those
types. Such adapters must remain pure translation helpers: no socket polling,
no X mutation, no rendering, no process supervision, and no payload retention.

`HeadlessSessionDriver` may execute runtime command sequencing against
deterministic headless adapters. It may own `SessionRuntimeLoop` state and a
last-committed layout cache. It must not become the real compositor event loop:
blocking file-descriptor polling, libinput intake, DRM/KMS commits, X socket
dispatch, broker socket dispatch, and process supervision remain outside this
headless test driver.

CLI smokes that exercise a complete runtime tick should use
`HeadlessSessionDriver`. Direct `SessionRuntimeLoop` use in CLI code should be
reserved for narrow adapter checks where no frame should be planned, such as
broker health packet routing or isolated WM transaction observation.

`RuntimeDriverAdapter` is the command-execution seam between the reducer and
external sources. Implementations must answer runtime commands with reduced
observations or existing frame reports. Live adapters may wrap X bridge, WM
socket, broker, portal, chrome, and renderer sources, but they must not expose
raw X events, namespace launch/auth tokens, metadata strings, portal payload
bytes, icon bytes, or unbounded buffers through the runtime loop.

Live adapter constructors must take non-blocking intake values that were already
reduced by the owning boundary. The runtime executor may receive counts,
transaction outcomes, broker health summaries, portal command counts, chrome
command counts, layer snapshots, and frame reports. It must not become the
place that parses X protocol payloads, blocks on sockets, validates clipboard
payload bytes, reads icon data, or owns renderer import buffers.

Process-supervised portal and metadata broker placeholders are runtime
ownership records. They prove that the runtime can start, poll, and terminate
the intended broker process kinds before the real broker IPC protocols exist.

Broker health is a bounded control packet, not a general metadata channel.
`BrokerHealthPacket` may name only the broker kind, coarse health state,
generation, and an optional short status message. It must not contain client
titles, XIDs, namespace IDs, portal payload bytes, file paths, URIs, or icon
data. The message is capped by
`SOPHIA_BROKER_HEALTH_MAX_MESSAGE_LEN` so a supervised broker cannot force
unbounded allocation in Sophia Engine or runtime.

Broker health uses the same explicit IPC frame header as WM packets. The
`BrokerHealth` message kind stores the health generation in the frame
transaction field, then encodes broker kind, health state, and optional bounded
UTF-8 status text. The portal and metadata placeholder smokes round-trip this
frame before any real broker payload protocol exists.

`SessionRuntimeState` records broker health as reduced state only: health
state, generation, and status-message length. It does not retain the status
message string. Stale health generations are ignored so an older broker report
cannot overwrite a newer readiness/degraded/stopped observation.

### Historical XWindowMirror

The retired Sophia X Bridge kept a mirror of the XLibre window tree. This is
historical cache design, not an active or target authority interface.

Fields should describe:

- X window ID and generation
- parent and children relationships
- top-level/client relationship
- map state
- stacking rank
- namespace identity when known
- stale metadata flags

The native X Server Frontend owns its resource tables directly and receives
namespace identity from session admission. It must not reconstruct identity by
mirroring another server.

Picom's window-tree mirror is the reference shape, but Sophia's mirror should
emit snapshots instead of owning render policy.

### LayerSnapshot

A layer snapshot is the reduced frame value that Sophia Engine render planning
consumes. It currently comes from the Sophia X Server Frontend; a future
frontend must produce the same protocol-neutral value.

Fields should describe:

- Sophia surface ID
- protocol-local window/object ID when relevant
- namespace ID
- stack rank
- geometry in compositor coordinates
- source pixmap or buffer handle
- damage region
- opacity, crop, and transform state

The snapshot is flat and immutable for the frame that consumes it.

### SurfaceOutputReservations

An output reservation is a bounded policy fact attached to an opaque Sophia
surface. Protocol frontends reduce native shell hints into complete
replacement snapshots; Engine owns activation and output clipping.

Fields should describe:

- surface ID;
- edge (`left`, `right`, `top`, or `bottom`);
- positive root-relative depth;
- half-open span on the edge's orthogonal axis.

One surface may publish at most one reservation per edge. Empty replacement
snapshots clear prior state. Engine activates a snapshot only for a mapped
`ClientPositioned` surface, removes it on unmap or surface retirement, takes
the maximum depth for the same edge, and combines different edges. The reducer
uses root coordinates so partial reservations project deterministically across
multiple outputs. Protocol atoms, native object IDs, window types, class/title
metadata, and application identity do not belong in this record.

### AuthoritySurface

An authority surface is a protocol-facing record owned by a protocol authority.
It maps protocol-local objects, such as X windows or future frontend surfaces, to a
Sophia `SurfaceId`.

Fields should describe:

- authority kind
- protocol-local object ID and generation
- Sophia surface ID
- namespace ID
- protocol-visible map/configure state
- protocol constraints and capabilities

Authority surfaces are not compositor surfaces. They are the authority's private
resource table entries that emit snapshots or surface transactions.

### SurfaceTransaction

A surface transaction is the atomic visual handoff from a protocol authority and
WM policy into Sophia Engine.

Fields should describe:

- transaction ID
- authority kind and surface ID
- namespace ID
- target geometry
- target content set, normalized from a single buffer source when no additional
  raster variant exists
- damage region
- readiness state
- deadline or timeout policy
- previous committed generation

Sophia Engine may accept, reject, wait on, or time out a transaction. It should
not present a transaction's new geometry unless the matching target buffer is
ready.

### CommittedSurfaceState

Committed surface state is the last visually safe state Sophia Engine may
present.

Fields should describe:

- surface ID
- committed generation
- committed geometry
- committed immutable content set
- output assignment
- visible state
- damage carried into the next frame

Slow-client fallback presents this state, not partially updated pending state.

The current Rust records still carry one `BufferSource`. The target
multi-monitor contract lifts it into a singleton `SurfaceContentSet`; changing
that representation does not change which authority owns the pixels or when a
candidate becomes committed.

### SurfaceContentSet And SurfaceContentVariant

A surface content set is the bounded protocol-neutral raster content admitted
for one surface generation. It allows a protocol authority to provide several
pixel-density realizations without moving protocol rendering semantics into
Engine.

Fields should describe:

- surface, namespace, transaction, and content generation
- logical content extent
- bounded ordered content variants
- authority-owned readiness and damage identity

Each variant should describe:

- stable variant identity
- protocol-neutral buffer source
- pixel size, logical extent, density, and source transform
- readiness or synchronization state
- variant damage

The set is immutable after admission. Existing single-buffer authorities emit a
singleton set. Additional or replacement variants enter through a new authority
transaction rather than mutating submitted work. Engine validates identity,
bounds, and readiness; the owning authority remains responsible for the claim
that opaque variants contain the same logical content.

### SurfaceRasterRequirements

Raster requirements are an advisory Engine-to-authority record. They describe
which raster classes would avoid sampling for one surface without disclosing
physical output topology.

Fields should describe:

- surface and committed-content generation
- requirement/topology generation
- logical content extent
- bounded ordered density and transform classes

The record contains no output, head, connector, mode-object, or framebuffer
identity. An authority may answer through a later surface transaction, and the
current best ready variant remains renderable in the meantime. Stale responses
cannot mutate the committed content set.

### DamageFrame

Damage is a frame artifact. It describes what changed between one committed
layout and another, not a mutable property of a window object.

Fields should describe:

- output ID
- frame serial
- buffer age
- root/background generation
- affected layers
- screen-space damage regions

Picom's buffer-age damage math is the reference idea. Sophia should keep the
calculation over layer snapshots, not live windows.

### RenderHeadId And HeadRenderTarget

`RenderHeadId` is a session-scoped opaque typed ID for one physical
presentation target. The backend retains connector, CRTC, card, and plane
identity; WM and protocol-facing records never receive it.

A head render target should describe:

- opaque head ID and owning logical output
- topology/target generation
- native pixel size and transform
- refresh and reduced presentation capabilities
- reduced renderer/KMS transport and format capability identity

A mode, transform, device, or capability change creates a new generation.
Prepared work cannot be rebound to a replacement target.

### OutputSceneSnapshot

An output scene snapshot is the immutable, target-independent visual intent for
one logical output generation. It is the point at which a scene fans out into
physical-head work.

Fields should describe:

- logical output and scene generation
- viewport and logical transform policy
- ordered committed surface/content generations and geometry
- compositor display-list and cursor state
- logical damage

It must not contain a connector, CRTC, native target size, selected raster
variant, framebuffer, or renderer handle.

### HeadCompositionPlan

A head composition plan lowers one output scene snapshot for one opaque,
generation-checked native target.

Fields should describe:

- logical output, scene generation, opaque render-head ID, and target generation
- native target shape and exact logical-to-head transform
- ordered surface-to-content-variant bindings with sampling classification
- native placements, clips, compositor primitives, cursor state, and damage

The plan is immutable and renderer-neutral. The renderer executes it without
consulting current scene state or a distinguished primary output.

### OutputPresentationCohort

An output presentation cohort joins the physical candidates that realize one
logical output generation.

Fields should describe:

- output and scene generation
- fixed required-head set
- prepared, submitted, flipped, lost, and cleanup sets
- terminal outcome and reduced logical timing

A `HeadFrameCandidate` binds a reduced target descriptor and affine lease token
to the exact head-plan identity it realizes. Renderer/backend-private state
behind that token retains the native resources; neither the candidate nor the
cohort exposes native handles. The cohort owns only the transitions that decide
when the shared logical generation is presented and when its last native owner
is releasable. The configured primary head owns logical presentation. Other
heads consume the newest complete generation on their own vblank and may
coalesce generations they missed; a generation's resources remain retained
until every head that scanned it has moved on. Logical outputs remain
independent of one another.

### FrameClockTick

A frame-clock tick is the scheduling value that starts compositor frame work.

Fields should describe:

- output ID
- frame serial
- target presentation time in the clock's monotonic domain

The headless backend uses a deterministic clock so tests are repeatable. A real
DRM/KMS backend should produce the same value shape from page-flip or vblank
timing rather than pushing backend-specific timing state into frame planning.

### PageFlipCommitGate

A page-flip commit gate stages authority-native surface transactions until the
output presentation boundary arrives.

Fields should describe:

- output ID
- transaction ID
- staged surface transactions

The gate may only commit on a matching output tick. If the tick is for another
output, or any staged transaction is not ready, the gate preserves the last
committed visual state. This keeps atomic rendering fail-closed for slow or
misbehaving apps: old geometry and old buffers remain visible until a complete,
validated transaction can advance on the presentation boundary.

The gate owns only the transactions changed by that atomic handoff. Stable
scene surfaces come from `CommittedSurfaceState`; they must not be copied from
a historical transaction table and relabelled with the newest presentation ID.
A queued Present therefore owns its exact `SurfaceTransaction`, and its
prepared candidate overlays that transaction onto the committed baseline.
Hit-testing and routed-input snapshots continue to use the committed baseline
until page-flip retirement promotes the candidate.

The live intake envelope may carry several ordered atomic transaction groups,
for example when a quarantined admission becomes ready while an unrelated
frontend batch arrives. Every group retains its own `TransactionId`; surface
transactions, CPU pixel mutations, removals, and Present submissions are
validated together before Engine preparation. A CPU mutation must have exactly
one matching CPU-buffer transaction in its group, so deferred pixels cannot
change a renderer buffer before their logical operation commits. Native buffer
and fence registrations remain on the
bounded envelope because their protocol requests may precede the Present that
consumes them. An envelope is batching, never authority to relabel one group's
transactions with another group's ID.

### LayoutEpochState

A layout epoch records surfaces that must produce damage before an atomic layout
change is considered visually ready. In the XLibre prototype this models a
tiered XSync/Damage compromise. In the long-term authority architecture,
`SurfaceTransaction` readiness should replace heuristic damage waiting wherever
the authority can prove buffer/geometry pairing directly.

Do not treat epochs as the universal frame scheduler. They are compatibility
state for implicit X11 readiness. Authority-native commits should flow through
`SurfaceVisualStateTable`: pending `SurfaceTransaction` values are staged beside
the last `CommittedSurfaceState`, and only transactions with ready state,
non-empty geometry, concrete buffer source, valid surface, and matching previous
generation may advance committed visual truth.

Fields should describe:

- epoch serial
- pending surface IDs
- start timestamp
- timeout policy
- committed content extent per affected surface
- one evidence-ranked `SafeSurfaceObservation` per affected surface:
  exact `SurfaceTransactionKey` (transaction, surface, and target buffer),
  content extent, evidence class, and Engine observation sequence
- declared and temporary effective constraints
- resize participation state: unmanaged, pending-layout, or managed
- bounded recovery-attempt state

X Damage events retire pending surfaces from the epoch in the prototype path.
Native authority commits should retire pending surfaces by explicit readiness
instead.

Timeout recovery is a replan, not a degraded visual commit. A
`ReplanAtCommittedExtent` decision retains the last `CommittedSurfaceState` and
publishes an exact safe extent as a temporary capability fact. It must never
construct committed state from a timed-out pending transaction. The external
WM remains responsible for placement and may choose to float the constrained
node.

The safe extent is an authority observation, not committed visual truth. It may
come from a complete quarantined buffer that was never displayed. During
admission, a complete presented buffer outranks an accumulated backing
snapshot, and equal evidence is ordered by the Engine-assigned observation
sequence. A later policy-sized clear therefore cannot replace a retained client
frame as recovery truth. Once managed, ordinary newest-complete-observation
ordering resumes. The epoch coordinator can use the selected extent to form a
bounded recovery request only while its exact transaction remains in the
pre-admission quarantine; a candidate-less or unavailable observation cannot
become an admission constraint. The constraint follows the selected candidate
through `AwaitingPixels` and becomes immutable in `AwaitingRetirement`, without
claiming that its pixels reached the scene.

Safe extents and declared constraints remain client-content values inside
authority and visual-state records. WM snapshots carry outer allocation values.
Both directions use the shared Engine chrome geometry conversion; adapters and
compatibility bridges must not add or subtract clearance independently.

Resize behavior samples are derived from the same epoch state. They should
record elapsed time, timeout policy, completion, timeout status, and remaining
pending surfaces so slow clients can be measured without reaching into renderer
or X bridge internals.

For the prototype, epochs should be created only for surfaces marked
`ResizeSyncCapability::ExplicitSync`. Timed-out epochs may be expired by the
engine, which returns the pending surfaces as a bounded timeout report for the
bridge or authority to score.

### SurfacePresentationAdmissionState

Surface admission tracks policy-managed presentation before a surface has
pixels. Its passive records contain only an opaque surface ID, presentation
role, client-content geometry, generic size constraints, and generation.
Protocol object IDs, application identity, titles, classes, and buffers do not
enter the admission table.

The phases are:

- `PolicyPending`: the frontend observed map intent while the protocol window
  remains unmapped;
- `ControlPending`: Engine accepted a WM proposal and issued one transaction-
  keyed configure/map control;
- `AwaitingPixels`: the frontend acknowledged that protocol control, while
  visual state still waits for a matching concrete buffer;
- `AwaitingRetirement`: an exact surface/transaction/target-buffer Present
  group owns the candidate, while visual focus and managed state wait for its
  native frame retirement, regardless of whether its storage is DMA-BUF or an
  immutable CPU materialization;
- `Managed`: matching geometry and pixels retired atomically.

The X authority classifies only non-override-redirect root children as
policy-managed toplevels. Parent links and direct-child queries stay in its
protocol table. Mapping descendants is client-positioned lifecycle work and
cannot transition the parent or an unrelated root child.

The authority reduces software child-window drawing into a toplevel
presentation buffer keyed by the root child's X record. Child geometry
translates damage; the resulting Sophia transaction carries only the
toplevel's opaque surface ID. Its concrete extent grows from observed backing
storage and is capped by the toplevel, so configured geometry is never confused
with ready pixels.

Pre-admission drawing is reduced into a bounded FIFO of transaction-homogeneous
groups. Each group retains its original `TransactionId`, surface transactions,
and associated Present submissions; it may update safe observed extents, but
it cannot enter the committed layer table or renderer intake. The matching
admission commit moves the evidence-selected complete group across the visual
boundary once, at accepted geometry and a rebased Engine generation.
Each PresentedBuffer transaction has exactly one matching Present submission
with the same surface and target buffer. DMA-BUF and software submissions use
the same exact key even though their renderer resources differ. Partial groups
are never split or relabelled, and one atomic group cannot claim both storage
paths. Buffer and fence releases remain deferred while any quarantined or
just-released group references them; renderer ownership begins before release
is observed. The FIFO holds at most 256 groups; capacity exhaustion or a
mismatched member is an explicit terminal error, never an unbounded allocation
or an immediate GPU submission.

That terminal rule is this FIFO's, not every bounded resource's. Only its second
clause generalises: no bounded resource may answer pressure by allocating past
its bound. What a resource does *at* its bound is a property of the resource,
recorded beside its capacity rather than decided at each call site, and the
choices are enumerated under Saturation Dispositions below. Reading the first
clause as blanket policy is how identical resource classes came to behave
oppositely -- a per-client input queue closing one endpoint while the shared
ingress killed the session, a focus handoff discarding a held sequence while the
pressed-key ledger treated the same pressure as fatal.

A selected complete presented buffer covers older admission groups for that
surface. Older Present groups cross intake only for explicit Skip/Idle
settlement; older backing-only groups are discarded without entering committed
state. Groups newer than the selected candidate remain quarantined through its
page-flip retirement and then drain in original order with rebased generations.
This keeps resource lifetime and client feedback exact without allowing an
unselected blank snapshot to become visual truth.

A DMA-BUF candidate for a surface with no committed content must not be skipped
merely because its first frame is outside the current view. The presentation
scheduler retains that exact candidate and its resources, without making it
runnable, until the surface belongs to the presentation and its animated
geometry intersects its assigned output. Other surfaces remain runnable.
This preserves admission's retirement dependency through scrolling and hidden
workspaces. Surface removal and session shutdown drain the retained candidate
through the existing cancellation path. Already committed surfaces retain the
ordinary offscreen Skip behavior.

Recovery keeps layout history and visual readiness as separate facts. A safe
or committed extent may constrain the blind WM's next proposal, but
`retained_matches` is never pixel evidence for a surface still owned by
presentation admission. Such a surface is included in the proposal's
admission-finalization set even when its geometry did not otherwise change,
and the proposal cannot commit until an exact concrete transaction is staged.
This prevents an unrelated resize or fixed-extent recovery from publishing a
bufferless layer, border, or focus target.

Withdraw and removal transitions erase the passive facts idempotently. A
terminal timeout withdraws the still-pending protocol window rather than
mapping a blank surface. Planning may derive a bufferless temporary layout node
from these facts, but that node is never inserted into committed visual state.

Slow-client timeout reporting must remain aggregate at runtime boundaries.
Counts for preserved and explicitly degraded timeouts are acceptable. Raw
surface IDs, protocol object IDs, namespaces, classes, titles, and payload data
must stay inside the authority or bridge that owns them.

### DrmKmsOutputDescriptor

A DRM/KMS output descriptor is the backend-facing record for one discovered
output before Sophia has a full device backend.

Fields should describe:

- Sophia output ID
- DRM connector ID
- DRM CRTC ID
- active mode size and refresh
- compositor scale

The descriptor is not authority to scan out by itself. It is the data contract
between future device discovery and existing frame planning.

Its connector and CRTC IDs are backend-facing here and stay that way. The
per-head composition target in
[Multi-Monitor Composition](multi-monitor-composition.md) replaces them at the
Engine boundary with an opaque `RenderHeadId`, leaving the backend to map native
identity. Read the fields above as what discovery reads from the device, not as
a licence to carry connector or CRTC identity into Engine, WM, or
protocol-facing records.

`DrmKmsSysfsDiscovery` is the first real discovery adapter. It reads connected
connector directories, mode lists, optional connector/CRTC IDs, and optional
scale values from a sysfs-style tree. Missing CRTC IDs must remain explicit as
`0`; only a later libdrm/ioctl backend can authoritatively bind connectors to
CRTCs, planes, and page-flip timing.

### RenderCommand

Render commands are the final planned compositor work for one frame.

Fields should describe:

- operation kind
- source surface or buffer
- destination output
- target region
- clip
- transform
- alpha or effect parameters

The command stream is Sophia Engine authority. Protocol authorities do not own
this data.

### BufferImportReport

A buffer import report describes how the renderer attempted to consume a layer's
buffer source for one validated frame.

Fields should describe:

- surface ID
- original buffer source
- requested import path
- path actually used
- imported buffer handle used by the renderer
- whether a fallback path was used

The default headless renderer always uses CPU readback as the execution path,
including as fallback for `XPixmap` or `DmaBuf` sources. Import-capable
renderers may use native `XPixmap` or `DmaBuf` handles when supported. A GPU
renderer should keep the same report shape so tests can distinguish "requested
import path" from "used path" without inspecting renderer-private state.

### NativeRenderTargetSlot

Native rendering models the complete GPU target as a generation-checked pool
slot. Physical AMDGPU evidence does not permit splitting a retained EGL/GL
context from the GBM/EGL surface it rendered. A slot is keyed by a reduced
output generation, dimensions, format, and normalized modifier set, and owns
the renderer-private context, pipeline, and surfaces as one unit.

A target slot has one of these flat
states:

- free
- rendering
- scanout leased
- retiring

The normal transition is `free -> rendering -> scanout leased -> retiring ->
free`. Page-flip retirement is the only authority that completes the final
transition. Pool exhaustion becomes bounded frame deferral; reference counts
must not be treated as lease state. Native handles remain inside the renderer
and backend.

Production GL execution uses the same state as flat worker records:

- `RendererWorkerRequestId` identifies one immutable owned frame command;
- `RendererWorkerLeaseId` identifies one worker-retained native scanout BO;
- the owner-side shared-file lease contains only the reduced descriptor, ID,
  and bounded release channel;
- the worker-side lease table contains the native EGL/GBM owner.

Neither record contains protocol objects, WM facts, callbacks, or Engine
authority. Worker completion does not imply presentation. `Pending` reduces to
backend deferral; only an accepted KMS page flip advances presentation, and
only retirement releases the worker lease. A soft stall is a metric. A hard
stall quarantines the worker and rejects the pending visual candidate without
fabricating Complete or Idle.

Renderer/KMS transport is a required topology fact:

- `SharedDrmFile` submits renderer GEM handles directly and never PRIME-imports
  them back into the same handle table;
- `IndependentDrmFile` submits only through complete PRIME plane FDs and never
  falls back to renderer-local handles.

Every scanout owner declares one mode. Missing independent-file FDs fail
closed before framebuffer creation.

The protocol-neutral Present scheduler holds exactly one flat in-flight
variant per output:

- `Rendering` owns the transaction, prepared Engine commit, and displayed
  layer while a worker request is pending;
- `Submitted` owns the same immutable record after KMS accepts the buffer.

Promotion changes only the variant. It does not reconstruct the record from
current scene state. Queue replacement can affect only queued Presents; it
cannot mutate either in-flight variant. Retirement or controlled failure is
the sole path back to no in-flight Present.

Retained frame queueing carries a typed requirement. `LatestScene` may reuse an
identical pending, rendering, submitted, or displayed logical scene.
`FreshRetirement` always creates a new native frame because Present feedback
needs a new physical clock event even when the pixels are identical. A
software-Present record moves from the teardown-visible waiting queue only
after its complete output cohort is validated and queued; fallible staging
never creates an untracked ownership gap.

`OutputFramePresentationState` and native scanout content mirror the same
four-stage data lifecycle: `Pending -> Rendering -> Submitted -> Presented`.
Each transition moves the immutable record rather than reconstructing it from
the newest scene. A separate newest-pending record may coexist with rendering
or submitted work. A 500 ms submitted-page-flip watchdog is the terminal
safety boundary for a lost DRM callback.

Process-external takeover deadlines belong to operator tooling, not these
records. They terminate a wedged session process group and restore saved TTY
state without adding application identity or benchmark timing to Engine data.

Startup evidence is a surface-keyed monotonic reduction. Stable retirement and
nonzero-pixel facts may arrive before focus control completes, but are applied
only after the same `SurfaceId` becomes the pinned startup surface. Native
recovery clears presentation facts while retaining the authoritative pin and
focus state. A presentation-layer fact must not be invalidated by inspecting
the base surface buffer or by requiring membership in the base committed list,
which may be absent while a DRI3 lease is displayed. CPU visual evidence
depends on that record; exact surface-keyed GPU evidence does not.
Native retirement has one reduction path even though more than one owner-loop
phase may drive the backend. The shared reducer owns admission retirement,
stable-presentation evidence, and structured retirement records; callers retain
only their phase-specific input-proof and timing updates.

Retained-buffer cadence is bounded cold evidence, not a stream of formatted
hot-path log records. The owner stores at most 8,192 UST intervals, derives
mean cadence and exact p95 at completion, and reports whether samples were
nonadvancing or capacity overflowed. Reporters reject incomplete evidence
instead of silently substituting wall-clock log timestamps.

Worker maintenance is a bounded command/acknowledgement exchange. Completion
metrics are sampled only after cache clearing returns its updated counters.
Import count, hit count, eviction count, and live entries remain separate
facts: a changing-generation stream may correctly have zero hits, but shutdown
must have zero live entries.

### Historical CompositePixmapRecord

A composite pixmap record described the retired XLibre bridge-owned lifetime of
one named XComposite pixmap. It is retained as buffer-lifetime evidence, not as
the native X frontend's presentation contract.

Fields should describe:

- client window ID
- named pixmap ID
- pixmap generation

Replacing a named pixmap must produce a lifetime update containing the retired
record. Removing a window must retire the current record. Render import can then
release old resources from explicit lifetime events instead of guessing from raw
pixmap integers.

### CompositorSurface

A compositor surface is Sophia Engine's stable handle for visual placement and
render scheduling.

Fields should describe:

- surface ID
- current layer snapshot generation
- committed geometry
- active buffer handle
- output assignment
- visibility state
- damage accumulator

The surface may refer back to a protocol-local object, but it is not that
protocol object.

### InputEventPacket

The compositor-side input packet is the value Sophia Engine produces after
reading libinput.

Fields should describe:

- seat and device
- event kind
- time
- global position
- target surface when known
- local coordinates
- buttons, keycodes, modifiers, valuators

The packet is not delivered directly to a client. Engine resolves the visible
`SurfaceId` and sends a reduced route to the owning protocol authority, which
still applies its protocol delivery semantics.

### LibinputDeviceDescriptor

A libinput device descriptor is the backend-facing record for one discovered
physical input device before Sophia has a real poll loop.

Fields should describe:

- seat ID
- device ID
- broad device kind

The event source accepts packets only when the device is registered and the
packet seat matches the device seat. This keeps physical-input intake explicit
before the compositor starts doing scene hit-tests and routed-input generation.

Physical input polling is represented by `NonBlockingInputPoller` and
`LibinputPhysicalInputAdapter`. Production backends should implement the trait
with non-blocking libinput dispatch over ready file descriptors. Tests should
use deterministic queued pollers rather than opening `/dev/input` devices.
Runtime backend assemblies accept any `NonBlockingInputPoller`; the default type
remains `QueuedInputPoller`, while live backend feature tests can substitute the
native-shaped libinput poller at the same boundary.
`PhysicalInputIntakeReport` is the runtime-facing proof for that boundary. It
may report poll counts, rejected intake outcomes, queued physical event count,
and `PhysicalIntakeOnly`; it must not report routed X requests, target windows,
local coordinates, or scene hit-test decisions.

### InputRoute

An input route is the compositor's answer to "what visual surface did this event
hit?"

Fields should describe:

- input event serial
- target surface ID
- global coordinates
- local coordinates
- transform used for inversion
- route confidence or rejection reason

This packet is Sophia Engine authority, but final delivery remains protocol
authority. Authority-local XIDs or future protocol objects are resolved inside that
authority and never become Engine routing keys.

Transformed scene hit-testing must produce target-local coordinates by applying
the inverse layer transform to the physical pointer position before checking
layer geometry. Hit-test walks should prefer the highest stack rank so a
transformed top layer wins over lower overlapping layers.

### RoutedInputDecision

The owning protocol authority answers an Engine route with a reduced decision.

Fields should describe:

- input serial or opaque delivery token;
- target surface ID;
- accepted, rejected, flushed, or failed outcome;
- bounded rejection reason.

Expected rejection outcomes include stale target, denied namespace,
sync-frozen protocol state, focus policy, unsupported event, backpressure, and
client disconnect. X11 grabs may redirect an accepted route according to normal
X semantics. Engine treats rejection as a closed route and never falls back to
direct client delivery.

### LayoutTransaction

The WM emits layout transactions, not one-off mutations. WM geometry describes
an outer layout allocation. Engine combines that passive allocation with its
committed chrome policy to derive client-content geometry. Protocol authorities
receive only the resulting content request and never receive compositor chrome
style or decoration math.

Fields should describe:

- transaction ID
- affected surfaces
- requested client sizes
- focus changes
- workspace/tag changes
- render positions
- z-order
- outer layout allocations; Engine-owned decoration clearance remains private
- timeout policy

Sophia Engine commits the transaction as a unit when possible. If clients lag,
the engine may fall back after the transaction timeout.

### WM Request and Response Packets

The external WM boundary uses explicit request and response packets.

Request packets should describe:

- transaction ID
- manage, relayout, or remove event kind
- opaque layout node snapshots
- output and workspace IDs
- workspace bounds

Response packets should describe command intent:

- workspace assignment
- configure size
- focus
- render placement

The response can be reduced into a `LayoutTransaction` for Sophia Engine. The
WM remains outside the compositor's per-frame and per-input hot paths; it only
receives coarse manage/relayout events and returns policy commands.

The durable WM IPC format is a bounded binary frame:

```text
u32 magic              "SOPH"
u16 protocol_version
u16 message_kind
u64 transaction_id
u32 payload_len
u32 reserved
[payload bytes]
```

All integers are little-endian. Decoders must parse fixed offsets explicitly
with `from_le_bytes`; do not cast socket bytes into structs. A frame with an
unknown message kind, unsupported version, non-zero reserved field, truncated
payload, trailing bytes, oversized payload, or excessive vector count fails
closed. The first implementation lives in `sophia-protocol` and covers
`WmRequestPacket` and `WmResponsePacket`.

### TransactionCommit

A committed or rejected transaction is reported as data.

Fields should describe:

- transaction ID
- committed, rejected, stale, or timed-out outcome
- surfaces actually applied

Rejected transactions must preserve the last committed compositor state.

### LayoutNodeSnapshot

The WM receives opaque layout nodes, not X11 windows.

Fields should describe:

- Sophia `SurfaceId`
- workspace/tag identity
- broad surface kind
- move/resize/focus/close/fullscreen capabilities
- focus, urgency, fullscreen, floating, and visibility state
- size constraints
- current compositor geometry
- serial/generation

Fields must not include `XWindowId`, `NamespaceId`, raw title, app class, PID,
or icon pixels. App-specific behavior should come later from launch/session
policy hints, not WM sniffing of client metadata.

A layout node describes a manageable surface, not its place in a particular
policy data structure. It must not grow parent and child fields for a tiling
tree, column offsets for a scrolling layout, or presentation metadata for a
desktop shell. A policy process may keep any of those privately and return
ordinary Sophia commands.

### ChromeDescriptor

Chrome descriptors are compositor-owned presentation metadata. They are separate
from WM layout state.

Fields should describe:

- Sophia `SurfaceId`
- optional redacted display label
- compositor-owned icon token
- trust level
- attention state
- serial/generation

The compositor may use this data to draw title bars, top bars, tab strips, and
security badges. The external WM should not need this packet to tile or focus
surfaces.

The chain is reduced at every hop. An authority reduces its own raw metadata under
the broker's published disclosure rule and emits a bounded label; the broker adds
trust, icon token, and attention state; Engine receives the result. Raw properties
exist in exactly one process, the authority that already owns them.

Sanitized metadata broker output enters Sophia Engine as a bounded metadata
packet, not raw X properties. It may contain only `SurfaceId`, optional bounded
display label, redaction bit, icon token, trust level, attention state, and
generation. `ChromeDescriptorTable` maps accepted packets into `ChromeDescriptor`
entries and rejects invalid labels, invalid surfaces, and stale generations.
Descriptor removal follows the same generation rule.

Chrome actions are not WM commands. A compositor close button produces a
`ChromeActionRequest` owned by Engine/session policy, validated against surface
generation and capabilities, then translated by the owning protocol authority
into normal X11 close semantics. A future frontend would supply its own native
close translation. The WM receives only later layout consequences.

Session events are compositor/session inputs that may produce privileged
commands. For chrome close, `SessionEvent::ChromeAction` can produce
`SessionCommand::RequestPoliteClose`; it must not produce a WM command.
When a surface is actually removed, `SessionEvent::SurfaceRemoved` can produce
a `WmRequestKind::SurfaceRemoved` packet. This keeps WM relayout tied to X11
lifecycle consequences, not compositor chrome intent.

### Legacy SurfaceSnapshot

`SurfaceSnapshot` is the earlier X-shaped compatibility packet retained for
conversion tests. Native authorities should prefer protocol-neutral
`AuthoritySurface`, `SurfaceTransaction`, and `LayerSnapshot` values.

Fields should describe:

- Sophia `SurfaceId`
- X11 `XWindowId`
- `NamespaceId`
- current geometry
- mapped/unmapped state
- buffer or pixmap handle
- damage region
- serial/generation
- resize sync capability

Window titles, app classes, and sync reputation keys are authority-private
metadata.
They must not be copied into `SurfaceSnapshot` or `LayerSnapshot`; the snapshot
may carry only the reduced `ResizeSyncCapability`.

The snapshot is immutable once handed to Sophia Engine.

### FrameSnapshot

A frame is a value. Sophia Engine should be able to capture a frame plan for
tests and replay.

Fields should describe:

- output size and scale
- ordered surface list
- transforms and clips
- damage regions
- buffer handles
- transaction serials

Tests should compare frame snapshots before inspecting live process state.

### PortalTransfer

Namespace crossings are explicit data packets.

Fields should describe:

- transfer ID
- source namespace
- target namespace
- transfer kind
- MIME or protocol type
- byte size
- source generation
- deadline
- policy decision

Portals should never grant two namespaces general X11 visibility just to move
one piece of user-approved data.

The policy packet carries no payload or OS handle. The `sophia-portal` reducer
owns pending decisions and emits abstract allow, deny, revoke, or handoff
commands. Runtime executors own clipboard bytes, files, capture buffers, URI
launchers, notification effects, and protocol completion.

An allowed decision creates a separate bounded grant whose lifecycle is active,
completed, revoked, or expired. Source generation changes, disconnects,
deadlines, policy failure, executor failure, and broker restart fail closed.
The exact contract and portal taxonomy live in
[namespaces-and-portals.md](namespaces-and-portals.md).

Clipboard transfers are asynchronous. The X Server Frontend retains requestor
XID, selection/target/property atoms, timestamp, and source-owner generation.
Portal policy receives only normalized target/MIME facts and namespaces. Denial
or expiry becomes normal X11 selection failure, never synthetic input or a
blocked session.

Other portal reducers follow the same split: bounded metadata in policy,
protocol-specific context in the authority, payloads and handles in runtime
executors, and user-visible effects in the appropriate shell or launcher.

## Storage

Use dense tables inside a process. Use snapshots between processes.

Sophia Engine owns dense tables for surfaces, outputs, seats, devices,
committed visual state, and active transactions. Protocol authorities own their
client resource tables. Sophia WM owns policy state. Portal policy owns bounded
request/grant state; portal executors own active payload/handle operations.

No process should hold a mutable reference into another process's table. Cross a
boundary by serializing a packet or by passing an OS handle with explicit
ownership.

## Saturation Dispositions

Every bounded resource carries its capacity and its behaviour at that capacity
as data. Five dispositions exist and no site may invent a sixth:

- **Terminal** -- exhaustion is an explicit terminal error. Correct where
  continuing would present wrong pixels or split an atomic group, as in the
  pre-admission group FIFO above.
- **EndpointEpochClosed** -- one endpoint's epoch closes and its queued work is
  fenced, leaving other endpoints untouched. A close still emits the terminating
  boundaries it owes; a discarded key release is a modifier held down forever.
- **BoundedDeferral** -- admission waits, with a deadline and a named
  escalation. Declining to read is backpressure rather than loss when the
  producer buffers upstream. The deadline is what distinguishes this from an
  unbounded retry loop.
- **RejectAndConsume** -- the record is dropped and counted. Correct for
  diagnostics and timing sidecars, which must not be able to fail a frame.
- **DegradeWithCause** -- the work proceeds at reduced fidelity and says so.

Two rules bind all five. Ordered work is never merged to make room: two arrivals
may not become one record, because a resource that coalesces under pressure
reports success while losing user input. And boundary capacity is reserved --
room for every terminating boundary a resource still owes is held back from
ordinary work, so closing an endpoint is always possible.

`crates/sophia-protocol/src/capacity/` holds the vocabulary and the pure
admission arithmetic; `validation/tla/TargetInputPacing.tla` models it.

## Observability

Logs are another boundary. Engine diagnostics may carry opaque Sophia IDs,
generations, counts, outcomes, and timing data, but default logs must not carry
raw XIDs, namespace IDs, titles, classes, PIDs, icon pixels, portal payloads, or
buffer contents. Structured `tracing` spans and events should explain decisions
without weakening namespace isolation.

A degradation that says nothing is indistinguishable from working code, so every
non-terminal saturation reports at `warn` with the resource's own name, the
cause, and a cumulative count of what was lost. Reporting is coalesced -- first
occurrence, powers of two, cause change, first recovery -- because a resource
under sustained pressure would otherwise saturate the log as well. A truncation
that reports a discarded count of zero is a silent drop and is the one shape
this rule exists to forbid.

## Hot Paths

The hot paths are:

- physical input to compositor hit test
- compositor frame scheduling
- damage aggregation
- surface ordering and transform evaluation

Keep them allocation-light and branch-obvious. Slow policy work belongs in the
WM or portal processes. X11—and any future frontend's protocol
complexity—belongs in its frontend, not inside the compositor's inner frame
path.

Policy can be TEA-style. Compositor hot paths should be table/system style.

## Invariants

- Protocol authorities are the source of truth for their client resources.
- Sophia Engine is the source of truth for committed visual placement.
- Sophia must not present new geometry without matching committed pixels.
- Layer snapshots are frame values, not mutable windows.
- The WM proposes policy; the engine commits renderable state.
- Namespace crossings require portal packets.
- Namespace identity is assigned by session admission, not inferred from
  protocol metadata.
- Portal policy packets never carry payloads or raw protocol object IDs.
- A frame plan is immutable once rendering begins.
- A transaction has a serial and an outcome.
- A stale ID must fail closed.

validation evidence in `docs/research-log.md`.

## 2026-09-04 Milestone 14 Exit Retargeted To Development-Session Readiness

The user changed Milestone 14's exit to a usable, recoverable Hagia development
session. CP-14.3 now orders lifecycle repair, the live launcher and fallback,
bounded diagnostics, real terminal/Firefox/clipboard/layout/two-monitor use,
and evidence review. Readiness follows demonstrated tasks and resolved failures;
it requires no consecutive-clean-day timer. Milestone 14 remains open.

CP-14.2 retains its identifier and moves to Deferred, explicitly incomplete.
The comparison infrastructure is implemented: exact signed candidates, isolated
profiles, external capture ownership, physical cursor qualification, focused
visibility checks, split resources, deduplicated kernel frames, and sealing only
after teardown. Its verifier still requires all 36 rows. None of those rules or
the retained archives were weakened by changing the execution order.

The Firefox recovery work culminated in signed `2823807e`'s short physical
canary: changing nonblack pixels, exact native retirement, and clean logout in
43 ms. The later `cp14-schema4-251d9acd` run sealed nine Kitty rows and measured
Firefox row 10, then failed completion after VT resume reset native counters.
The suspended-seat loop also delays its runtime deadline. Those defects remain
the first active repair; the measured partial is not promoted.

The [decision and former queue](research-log.md#2026-09-04-milestone-14-retargeted-to-development-session-readiness)
retain the previous requirements and detailed recovery history. A changed
candidate still needs a fresh matrix if comparison work is explicitly resumed.
Comparison and optional soak completion no longer gate development-session use
or milestone closure. CP-15.1 and CP-15.2 follow the revised milestone.

## 2026-09-04 Native Tree Layouts And Tab Descriptors

Implemented Hagia frame-tree/Notion and split-tree/i3 topology, projection,
actions, and version-5 checkpoints with version-4 migration. Optional WM group
records preserve the frozen revision-3 counted wire. Shell revision 2 carries
persistent Narthex descriptors, with Sophia owning GPU composition and activation
against presented tab targets. Revision-1 shell clients remain supported.

The implementation and offline verification slice is complete; physical display
acceptance is part of CP-14.3 in `todo.md`. This seals no CP-14.2 comparison rows. See
[tabbed layouts](tabbed-layouts.md) for the contract, fallback, and operator gate.

## 2026-09-01 Milestone 14 Stable X Backing And Continuous Presentation

- [x] Replaced full immutable CPU presentation replacement for stable
  software-rendered X toplevels with lease-safe `Arc` copy-on-write backing,
  bounded damage history, and patch-preserving density derivation.
- [x] Restored sustained real-xterm progress by delivering core X `NoExpose`,
  bounding authority sequencing and shutdown, and requiring exact accepted-
  update ownership through surface removal, native queueing, and retirement.
- [x] Unified page-flip and out-fence completion under one bounded card pump
  and absolute monotonic clock, preserving exact logical retirement even when
  cadence validation rejects a sample.
- [x] Bound latest-wins to the unqueued CPU cell; queued native frames retain
  exact owners until presentation, lifecycle settlement, or proof that every
  native owner released the frame.
- [x] Passed the single-attempt physical terminal gate on signed commit
  `b9f0735ae3de0ab3f963fe19d6d117e0cbe6d403`: all 7,116 accepted
  post-startup updates were accounted, 1,190 were presented, 5,926 were
  superseded, none remained pending, and machine and visual verdicts passed.

Run `20260902T002500Z` retained a 16.586 ms maximum source gap, 18.825 ms
maximum display gap, and 31.737 ms maximum update-to-retirement latency on the
60 Hz physical workload, with clean authority, protocol, native-presentation,
and teardown state. This closes CP-14.1 only. The comparison and soak were the
planned exit evidence at that point; the explicit 2026-09-04 retargeting above
supersedes that execution requirement without changing this physical result.

---

## 2026-08-11 Milestone 12 Frozen Classical-WM Compatibility Baseline

- [x] Closed the intended xmonad desktop configuration: the packaged 0.18
  series builds without mutable `~/.config/xmonad` state; `ThreeColMid`, `Tall`,
  `Mirror Tall`, `Full`, and `Spiral` hold exact configured multi-surface
  geometry; `Tabbed`, title/class manage hooks, and xmonad-owned decorations
  stay excluded from the blind-WM contract; the configured xmonad and xmobar
  executables are immutable release inputs with recorded source revision, build
  configuration, and binary digest; and the retained personal profile's safe
  core became opaque Sophia actions behind an IR_Black-derived one-pixel Engine
  frame with xmobar static, redacted, and title-free.
- [x] Completed TrueColor semantics: the advertised 24-bit XRGB and 32-bit ARGB
  contract is internally exact, `AllocColor` converts RGB16 through the
  advertised masks, `QueryColors` recovers channel intensities instead of
  collapsing to white, `AllocNamedColor` uses a bounded deterministic table that
  returns the correct X error for unknown names, and the conventional
  1/4/8/15/16 auxiliary pixmap formats are advertised and proven separately from
  the TrueColor visuals in both byte orders. Visual IDs, colormap IDs, channel
  masks, and X color names stayed inside X Authority.
- [x] Rebuilt and re-proved the candidate across two-phase admission recovery
  and complete position-and-size geometry delivery, then passed each focused
  installed gate on immutable artifacts: xterm attempt `0003` on `7e18ea3a`,
  automatic Firefox run `0002` and the xmobar work-area gate on `4c312142`,
  physical TrueColor attempt `0003` and emergency-recovery attempt `0004` on
  `883666a2` with `reverified=0`, and ten-cycle lifecycle runs `0044` through
  `0053` on `883666a2` with two-output readiness between 288 and 324 ms.
- [x] Audited workspace and admission recovery with the commit-pinned Specula
  tool, retaining project-sized formal models and deterministic regressions
  rather than a runtime or build dependency. Preliminary soak attempt `0054`
  remains a failed immutable artifact; installed run `0055` on `a2fdf4f6` then
  held clean admission, workspace projection, two independently advancing
  animated surfaces, and zero layout timeout, resize abort, hidden-surface
  command, or WM restart.
- [x] Recorded the fixed-TrueColor row in the X11 compatibility matrix once both
  the wire regressions and the visible physical proof passed.

The installed-candidate lineage is retained failure evidence in order:
`1a7d67c3` (admission recovery), `7bd3e7db` (move feedback), `a50dfb67`
(committed-layout reseed), `53a21365` (false core `GetImage` ceiling),
`fb1c3804` (unbounded ephemeral Firefox profiles), `ce494942` and run `0042`
(resource lifecycle cleanup), `7a6be56c` (renderer-worker settlement during VT
handoff), and `4c312142` (closed that gap). Any reproduction of the historical
xmonad promotion or soak artifacts must use one of these exact immutable builds
or a verified source-identical successor.

This milestone froze xmonad as a compatibility baseline and regression corpus,
not as Sophia's promotion vehicle. Its profile-specific work stayed behind the
generic compatibility boundary and never made xmonad concepts part of Engine or
the universal WM API. The remaining practical short gate and long xmonad soaks
moved to the Classical X11 WM Compatibility section of `todo.md`; elapsed wall
time is not a promotion criterion. Hagia owns the active product path.

---

## 2026-08-07 Milestone 12 Precursor Gates

- [x] Checked the bounded visual-retirement, admission-recovery,
  Present-ownership, and surface-content transition models with the pinned
  offline TLC toolchain and mapped their actions to Rust authority boundaries.
- [x] Passed the 30-minute unattended daily-driver churn gate on signed commit
  `5fbfc849`: 25 application cycles, 75 closes, 11 layout-preserving bridge
  recoveries, and clean protocol, transaction, presentation, and teardown
  state after 1,901,036 ms.
- [x] Passed the one-shot ten-cycle physical installed lifecycle gate on signed
  commit `958fb5e6`. Attempts `0014` through `0023` reached two-output readiness
  in 291--336 ms, logged out through libinput, Engine, and blind WM policy,
  restored VT and termios state, and left no Sophia, bridge, or xmonad process.

These gates close formal-transition, unattended-churn, and lifecycle-repetition
prerequisites. They do not close the two-hour interactive soak or full-workday
gate. A later executable or packaged-policy change requires a new installed
candidate and repetition proof before those final captures.

---

## 2026-08-06 Milestone 11 Installed Daily-Driver Candidate

- [x] Promoted strict core/native-WM KDL configuration with safe discovery,
  validation, last-known-good reload, and explicit restart-only changes.
- [x] Established Engine-owned focus-ring and frame chrome behind blind-WM v6
  negotiation, generation-ordered policy updates, and atomic content clearance.
- [x] Installed one immutable, repository-independent release with normal,
  fallback, watchdog, emergency, Firefox, and native-chrome greetd entries.
- [x] Retained three consecutive normal archives plus independent fallback,
  watchdog, and emergency archives with exact binary/runtime identity and
  display-manager handoff.
- [x] Passed native chrome and live configuration proof, including the repaired
  tty7→tty3→tty7 renderer-image handoff and visible retained-frame retirement.

The historical three-cycle gate ends at normal archive `0005` on commit
`4cc84913`; fallback `0005`, watchdog `0003`, and emergency `0002` pass the
same installed-release contract. Native-chrome archive `0006` on commit
`d29e2f2c` captures and restores two renderer images, routes 28 physical keys,
retires retained content after seat reacquisition, and exits with clean
renderer, presentation, protocol, application, and VT ownership. Milestone 12
now owns repeated-cycle and soak stability; this archive does not claim those
long-duration gates.

---

## 2026-08-03 Milestone 10 Physical Firefox Workload

- [x] Reduced attached-dialog and floating-window behavior into generic opaque
  policy facts, Engine-owned placement validation, and transactional
  move/resize gestures without application heuristics.
- [x] Closed focused Firefox rendering, dialog, selection, lifecycle, resize,
  focus, input, and cleanup gates before the integrated run.
- [x] Passed one integrated physical workflow with all six Firefox stages and
  six Kitty retention checkpoints around normal and WM-forced status-zero
  Firefox exits.
- [x] Retained synchronous startup presentation on both outputs, asynchronous
  retirement on the active output, real DOM navigation and wheel progress,
  exact resized pixels, and clean session, layout, application, frontend,
  namespace, and Xauthority teardown.

Repetition moved to the installed unattended and interactive soak gates. The
completed Firefox milestone does not claim Chromium compatibility or general
X11 conformance.

---

## 2026-08-01 Milestone 9 xmonad Session Promotion

- [x] Passed the commit-pinned unattended semantic gate: retained M7 xmonad,
  M8 Firefox/Vulkan mix, and dual-output input/page-flip QEMU evidence.
- [x] Passed native chrome and hot-reload proof on the physical KMS path.
- [x] Passed the four-Kitty physical smoke with keyboard, pointer focus, both
  outputs, VT suspend/resume, persistent renderer resources, and clean logout.
- [x] Passed unmodified xmobar geometry, pointer, retained keyboard-focus, and
  clean recovery proof.
- [x] Passed independent Ctrl-Alt-Backspace emergency recovery with drained
  routed input, native presentation, and exact TTY restoration.

Commit `727c716d2f762bbed47e1132d7770dc8b92f5015` is the development-session
promotion point. It does not claim installed-session, physical Firefox, or
workday-soak promotion; those remain active Milestones 10 through 12.

---

## 2026-07-25 Architecture Conformance And Domain Split

- [x] Replaced application-specific session launch variants with opaque
  configuration-owned application IDs and kept Engine policy protocol-neutral.
- [x] Removed per-event input projection allocation and centralized
  authority-layer projection under Engine.
- [x] Split X authority state, service, routing, input, clipboard, wire,
  dispatch, and client output into bounded domain owners behind stable facades.
- [x] Split live-session policy, admission, WM/layout, input, presentation,
  process supervision, owner-loop state, and tick phases by ownership.
- [x] Split native scanout resource lifetime from composition execution and
  legacy-WM framing from runtime supervision.
- [x] Extracted visual diagnostics and asynchronous output servicing from the
  production runtime facade.
- [x] Moved production inline tests into integration tests and shared fixtures.
- [x] Replaced direct library printing and free-form traces with structured,
  bounded, redacted observations.
- [x] Replaced callback-owned mutation and Present delivery with explicit
  Engine projection and owner-drained queues.
- [x] Removed synthetic committed-surface seeding and client-local X
  identifiers from Engine/session routing.

The source-layout audit now prevents new unreviewed large modules, inline
production tests, and direct library printing. Reviewed exceptions remain in
`docs/source-layout-exceptions.txt`. Future splits follow domain ownership and
data flow rather than a strict line-count target.

---

## 2026-07-25 Physical Session Infrastructure

- [x] Added a fail-closed installed launcher requiring an owner-controlled
  runtime directory and real local VT.
- [x] Recorded ordered preflight, input-guard, graphics-takeover, session, and
  display-manager-handoff phases for normal and emergency exits.
- [x] Added immutable runtime identity and lifecycle evidence to promotion
  captures.
- [x] Installed versioned release binaries and a greetd session entry without
  compiling during login.
- [x] Replaced development takeover assumptions with explicit seat/VT
  ownership and bounded display-manager handoff.
- [x] Added the configured Firefox action, protocol-neutral wheel routing,
  deterministic physical verifier stages, and atomic no-focus behavior for
  hidden workspaces.

These mechanisms are established but do not constitute installed-session
promotion. The active roadmap still requires a repository-independent release
path and repeated physical workflow evidence.

---

## 2026-07-24 Physical Kitty Recovery And Input Promotion

- [x] Added a guarded two-output Kitty-only TTY3 launcher with independent
  Ctrl-Alt-Backspace recovery, exact KD/keyboard/termios restoration, display
  manager handoff, libinput `seat0` discovery, and bounded startup readiness.
- [x] Established the direct Mesa GLX, DRI3/Present, mixed-composition,
  page-flip feedback, and classic hardware-cursor path required by real Kitty.
- [x] Fixed Present identity, selection, retirement, multi-output scheduling,
  cursor ownership, focus, event-selection, and TTY keyboard-ownership races
  found by repeated physical attempts.
- [x] Added a strict real-Kitty input gate requiring exact shell input and a
  later Present rather than treating socket writes as proof.
- [x] Found the final keyboard failure in X11 extension event allocation:
  advertising GLX event base zero made libX11 install GLX converters over core
  KeyPress and KeyRelease. Traditional extension ranges are now non-core and
  mutually disjoint.
- [x] Retained a passing physical TTY3 run with visible Kitty, routed keyboard
  and pointer buttons, 13 ms maximum cursor motion-to-submit, status-zero Kitty
  exit, clean protocol health, and normal originating-TTY restoration.
- [x] Made display-manager takeover wait for all graphical clients, ignore
  zombies, and terminate only exact lingering graphical PIDs before failing
  closed.

Commit `eb509a6` is the promotion point. This milestone proves the physical
Kitty-only session; it does not promote the physical xmonad/Firefox desktop.

---

## 2026-07-19 Wayland Frontend Retirement

- [x] Recorded Sophia as an X-centric product with a protocol-neutral Engine
  rather than a dual-protocol compositor.
- [x] Removed the Wayland frontend, commands, launchers, dependencies, and
  maintenance gates from the production workspace.
- [x] Preserved the former frontend, subsystem contract, tools, fixtures, and
  last evidence under `research/wayland` as design provenance.
- [x] Kept future compatibility translators architecturally possible but
  outside the roadmap unless a specification amendment admits one from named
  product evidence.

This retirement is post-M8 architecture cleanup. It does not change the
completed xmonad daily-driver criteria or its retained mix and soak evidence.

---

## 2026-07-19 xmonad Daily Driver

- [x] Added the normal supervised xmonad session with approved startup/action
  applications, logout, bridge recovery, and generic process-group ownership.
- [x] Closed Firefox compatibility gaps with focused wire regressions and an
  offline six-stage proof covering keyboard, pointer, resize, dialog,
  `CLIPBOARD`, `PRIMARY`, normal exit, and cleanup.
- [x] Passed three consecutive two-output mixed-application QEMU gates with
  xterm, GTK, Vulkan, Firefox, workspace movement, and bridge restart.
- [x] Passed the unattended 30-minute QEMU soak with 22 terminal, Firefox, and
  launcher cycles, 66 closes, zero unexpected protocol errors, no pending WM,
  action, or input work, and clean native/frontend/application teardown.

The retained `xmonad-m8-mix` and `xmonad-m8-soak` scenarios are the Milestone
8 regression contract. The accepted soak ran for 1,891,936 ms and completed
with 9,551 authority transactions and no native cleanup debt.

---

## 2026-07-18 Application Compatibility And Production Session Loop

- [x] Promoted paired xterm, GTK3 software, and mixed Vulkan application
  classes with strict protocol-error, presentation, input, and cleanup evidence.
- [x] Passed the unattended classic/confined GTK QEMU gate and retained guarded
  machine-specific Vulkan and recovery diagnostics.
- [x] Established `sophia-engine::runtime_driver` as the only production visual
  coordinator and removed CLI-owned scene, commit, scanout, and feedback timing.
- [x] Preserved fail-closed stale-generation, backpressure, acquire, page-flip,
  disconnect, surface-removal, and shutdown behavior with exact native cleanup.

The retained Milestone 5 and 6 gates remain regression contracts. New toolkit
or extension behavior must begin with a captured native-X compatibility gap and
the smallest focused wire regression.

---

## 2026-07-18 Interactive WM API And Legacy Bridge

- [x] Negotiated WM API version 2 with fail-closed capability and binding
  validation before any layout or action traffic.
- [x] Added Engine-owned physical shortcut routing, nine Engine-owned
  workspaces, atomic focus/workspace/layout effects, and approved named session
  actions.
- [x] Exercised the same blind API through the native demo WM and the generic
  legacy-WM bridge's metadata-free xmonad profile.
- [x] Passed the unattended two-output QEMU gate with real xmonad, three real
  xterm surfaces, physical virtio input, focus/layout/workspace operations,
  terminal launch, close, logout, bridge restart, and preserved committed state.

Commit `d6ee120` satisfies the milestone exit. The retained `xmonad-m7`
scenario and strict evidence verifier remain the regression contract.
Machine-specific DRM and input runs are optional compatibility diagnostics.

---

---

## 2026-07-14 X11 Session Correctness

- [x] Implemented the XKB keymap/state path and bounded X11 focus, active and
  passive grabs, keyboard, pointer, and required XI2 delivery while preserving
  Engine-selected targets and authority-local coordinates.
- [x] Replaced fixed root/output facts with Engine-sourced topology and RandR
  snapshots, including authenticated update notification and normal
  configure-plus-pixels resize behavior.
- [x] Preserved client-targeted input/control acknowledgements, bounded
  backpressure, deterministic focus/stacking, and complete disconnect cleanup.
- [x] Retained and strictly verified the paired native two-xterm session on the
  X13 under classic shared-X and a fresh zero-capability confined namespace.

Both schema-13 runs used physical evdev keyboard and pointer input, flushed all
routed X11 events, retained two independently interactive CPU layers, applied
the Engine output update with four RandR notifications, committed resized
pixels, presented through Engine-owned KMS, and drained without cleanup debt.
Classic startup readiness was 94 ms and confined readiness was 90 ms; both had
13 ms maximum CPU composition and 0 ms measured input-to-presentation latency.
The retained ignored logs are
`.evidence/remote-target/tmp/sophia-milestone3-{classic,confined}.log`.

## 2026-07-14 Portal Broker And X11 Clipboard

- [x] Split sanitized policy requests from single-use, generation-bound grants
  with bounded pending/active state, deadlines, completion, expiry,
  disconnect/executor revocation, and broker-restart invalidation.
- [x] Added owner-only bounded broker IPC, persistent lifecycle across client
  connections, a default-deny deterministic policy provider, correlated
  payload frames, and fail-closed disconnect handling.
- [x] Implemented ordinary same-namespace `SelectionRequest`, restricted
  `SelectionNotify` SendEvent, owner replacement `SelectionClear`, and
  per-connection sequence/routing behavior.
- [x] Implemented cross-namespace `CLIPBOARD`/`PRIMARY` through an
  authority-private source proxy. The broker sees only sanitized namespace,
  target, size, generation, grant, and payload values; Engine and policy never
  receive XIDs or atoms.
- [x] Implemented `TARGETS`, `UTF8_STRING`, and bounded UTF-8 `text/plain`.
  Denied, stale, expired, disconnected, unsupported, and executor-failure
  paths produce normal `SelectionNotify(property = None)`.
- [x] Deterministic and socket tests prove same-namespace ownership and
  handoff, a complete broker/source-proxy/target-property transfer, stale
  generation, expiry, disconnect, default/capability denial, and executor
  failure without granting general cross-namespace resource visibility.

## 2026-07-13 X11-First Roadmap Reset

- [x] Added a documentation source-of-truth map and a normative
  namespace/admission/portal contract, then reconciled architecture, DOD,
  subsystem status, validation, README, and the native X11 evidence matrix.
- [x] Removed XLibre from the production dependency graph, workspace, launcher,
  and installed session while preserving its source and evidence under
  `research/xlibre`.
- [x] Established a bounded concurrent native X frontend with disjoint creation
  ranges, connection cleanup ledgers, classic same-namespace resource access,
  client-attributed transaction batches, and targeted input/control routes.
- [x] Proved two real xterms concurrently reach Engine-owned CPU composition
  and dedicated KMS presentation. The retained optimized hardware run completed
  in 1,487 ms with 10 ms maximum composition, 23 ms
  input-to-presentation, all 14 events flushed, and no KMS cleanup debt.
- [x] Corrected initial focus, stacking, readiness, and startup sequencing so
  proof input cannot race a uniform startup surface or land behind an
  overlapping secondary client.
- [x] Completed the native Wayland SHM/Kitty foundation and retained controlled
  direct-scanout DMA-BUF first-frame and 300-frame lifecycle evidence.
- [x] Reframed Wayland and DMA-BUF expansion as maintenance/deferred work while
  namespace admission, portals, and the native X session become the active
  critical path.

The two-xterm result remains `hardware`, not `session`, evidence. Engine-derived
output facts, normal resize, XKB/grabs, independently credentialed confined
groups, and standard presentation feedback are still active work.

---

## 2026-07-13 Namespace And X Admission Foundation

- [x] Added immutable namespace profiles, directional capabilities, admission
  contexts, and a session-owned generation-safe namespace registry.
- [x] Replaced the production listener-wide namespace shortcut with
  per-connection admission after cookie authentication and kernel peer
  credential checks.
- [x] Added fresh owner-only Xauthority publication, launchable classic and
  confined profiles, disjoint connection XID ranges, and cleanup-attributed
  client identities.
- [x] Proved classic shared-resource access and confined denial for resource
  lookup, properties, selections, event selection, routed input, and metadata.
- [x] Added supervisor-triggered admission revocation that disconnects one
  worker and follows the normal route, resource, surface, selection, and lease
  cleanup path without disrupting a classic peer.

The milestone exit is satisfied: production sessions allocate namespace
identity through the registry; every policy-admitted connection retains an
immutable context; disconnect and targeted supervision converge on the same
fail-closed teardown sequence.

---

## Completed Native Wayland Foundation

- [x] Removed XLibre concepts from Engine input and surface records, replacing
  them with protocol-neutral surface routes and authority-local IDs.
- [x] Added a Smithay-backed private Wayland authority for `wl_surface`,
  `xdg_toplevel`, SHM, bounded linear DMA-BUFs, frame callbacks, buffer release,
  keyboard, and pointer delivery.
- [x] Ran real Kitty over the private Wayland socket with `DISPLAY` removed and
  changing nonzero SHM frames through Engine.
- [x] Made the installed Kitty launcher use the native Wayland authority and
  native KMS path while preserving the independent TTY recovery guard.
- [x] Made the XLibre bridge an opt-in research feature excluded from the
  production dependency graph and default workspace members, then moved the
  crate, bridge-only CLI, patches, scripts, fixtures, and protocol notes into
  the non-workspace `research/xlibre` archive.
- [x] Added direct EGL DMA-BUF import with no CPU readback and delayed Wayland
  presentation feedback until the matching KMS submission is observed.

---

## Completed Visible Interactive X Terminal

- [x] Backed core X drawing with bounded XRGB8888 CPU buffers, including the
  fixed-font xterm path, and composed those pixels into renderer-owned frames.
- [x] Kept X Authority, backend ticks, native scanout ownership, and xterm under
  one persistent session owner with clean submit, page-flip retirement, and
  cleanup evidence.
- [x] Routed QMP virtio-keyboard input through libinput and Engine focus, then
  repeated the exact 14-event `sophia` plus Return proof with an operator on AMD
  TTY hardware. Both paths changed later xterm pixels without internal X event
  injection.
- [x] Selected xterm's core-key event target from authority-private event masks,
  emitted the required focus transition, and withheld readiness until the
  nonzero prompt checksum was page-flip-confirmed.

## Completed xmonad Bridge And Stability Evidence

- [x] Ran real xmonad as metadata-blind layout policy through the isolated
  embedded X11 WM bridge and translated its two-window configure/focus requests
  into bounded Sophia WM packets.
- [x] Recorded bounded session latency, queue, callback, failure, and cleanup
  counters; passed the 30-second TTY stability run and isolated 300-tick QEMU
  run with dual-output keyboard/pointer evidence.

---

## Completed Real Backend Evidence and Runtime Seams

- [x] Added `live-session-composition-smoke`, composing the Sophia X Authority
  Present-pixmap socket path, bounded authority batch intake, runtime commit
  projection, renderer-live frame-target observation, rendered primary-plane
  scanout submit, deterministic page-flip retire, and cleanup-drained reporting
  into one non-destructive reduced evidence line.
- [x] Proved libinput-shaped input polling, native page-flip retirement, and
  rendered scanout submit can share one runtime tick.
- [x] Added a runtime-owned readiness gate so concrete libinput dispatch runs
  only after the session loop observes reduced readiness.
- [x] Kept physical input intake separate from routed-input transformation with
  reduced `PhysicalIntakeOnly` runtime evidence.
- [x] Preserved deterministic queued poller tests as the default validation
  path while keeping native libinput behind optional feature tests.
- [x] Collapsed one-shot helper calls into a reusable session loop owner.
- [x] Fed reduced input, page-flip, and scanout facts through one bounded tick
  budget.
- [x] Kept real file-descriptor readiness outside Sophia Engine state via a
  reduced readiness collector.
- [x] Recorded opt-in real GBM/EGL validation with reduced draw, presentation,
  and frame-target allocation evidence.
- [x] Defined renderer-private GBM/EGL frame-target lifecycle states: created,
  retained, resized, invalidated, and retired.
- [x] Added reduced runtime observations for frame-target lifecycle and
  allocation without implicit native allocation during ticks.
- [x] Added the first reduced KMS scanout target report and derived page-flip
  readiness from it.
- [x] Preserved CPU fallback and degraded GPU paths while scanout matures.
- [x] Added a fake live compositor loop smoke covering input polling, authority
  transaction intake, WM policy, renderer target observation, frame commit, and
  reduced page-flip observation.

---

## Completed GBM/EGL Frame Target Milestones

- [x] Proved a real composed xterm frame, identified by matching requested and
  exported checksums, reaches native GBM/KMS submit and accepted page-flip
  retirement on TTY3 without cleanup debt.

- [x] Defined the opt-in real-device evidence shape for native GBM/EGL
  frame-target allocation.
- [x] Extended real GBM/EGL smoke evidence with reduced frame-target allocation
  status while keeping native handles renderer-private.
- [x] Threaded reduced GBM/EGL frame-target readiness and allocation reports
  through backend-live and runtime observations without making Sophia Engine own
  renderer-private lifecycle.

---

## Completed Atomic Scanout Smoke Milestones

- [x] Added `tools/atomic_scanout_preflight.sh`,
  `tools/atomic_scanout_smoke.sh`, and the strict reduced evidence verifiers for
  preflight, destructive atomic scanout, and runtime rendered-scanout evidence.
- [x] Added `tools/atomic_scanout_hardware_proof.sh` as the combined operator
  proof for preflight, two-phase atomic scanout, and runtime submit-to-retire
  evidence.
- [x] Advanced reduced atomic scanout evidence to schema 10 and runtime
  rendered-scanout submit evidence to schema 6 with reduced scanout-buffer
  format, modifier, plane-count, format-table, framebuffer-creation, submit,
  retire, and cleanup-debt fields.
- [x] Added backend-private primary-plane `IN_FORMATS` discovery and bounded
  modifier parsing so rendered GBM/EGL scanout export can choose usable scanout
  candidates without exposing DRM property blobs or native modifier values.
- [x] Allowed explicit non-linear multi-plane XRGB8888/ARGB8888 buffers to
  reach modifier-aware AddFB2 while keeping unsupported implicit/linear
  multi-plane buffers rejected before native resource creation.
- [x] Made rendered GBM/EGL scanout skip rejected multi-plane export candidates
  and continue searching for a single-plane buffer when the driver rejects the
  modifier-aware framebuffer path.
- [x] Added backend-private PRIME import for renderer-exported DMA-BUF planes:
  backend-live imports them into the KMS submit device, builds AddFB2/AddFB from
  KMS-local handles, and closes imported GEM handles through the existing
  cleanup path.
- [x] Fixed the destructive smoke lifetime rule so the initial rendered GBM/KMS
  owner remains active until the steady page flip presents, then both resource
  bundles retire after accepted page-flip callbacks.
- [x] Captured TTY3 reduced smoke evidence where both `InitialModeset` and
  `SteadyPageFlip` pass with `framebuffer=CreatedWithAddFb2`,
  `page_flip=Presented`, `retire=RetiredAfterPageFlip`, and
  `retire_cleanup_pending=false`.
- [x] Closed the combined TTY3 hardware proof with verifier-accepted preflight,
  destructive two-phase atomic scanout evidence, and runtime rendered-scanout
  submit-to-retire evidence.

  persistent clients commit contiguous visual updates instead of replaying one
  stale `previous_committed_generation`.

  ready.
- [x] Move the long-running X Authority transaction side channel to a
  runtime-owned bounded queue while keeping callback observers for focused
  tests.

  closed instead of allocating unbounded buffers or dropping visual facts.

  unsupported minor opcodes failing closed.
- [x] Model `ShmAttach` as namespace-local metadata without mapping host memory.

  real SHM import path exists.

  mapped bytes through a bounded renderer import path.
- [x] Add protocol-neutral `AuthorityTransactionIntake` so runtime can commit
  authority batches without making Sophia Engine depend on Sophia X Authority.
- [x] Define the first runtime-owned backend assembly struct that holds output
  discovery, input polling, frame clock, authority transaction intake, and
  renderer selection without owning protocol policy.

  surface state and renders through the existing runtime driver.
- [x] Define the runtime event that reports authority process ready/degraded

  health observations.

  assembly through a protocol-neutral inbox.
- [x] Decide the first real backend dependency boundary for DRM/KMS and
  libinput without changing the Engine/WM/Authority packet contracts.

  behind deterministic backend discovery and assembly seams.

  IO behind traits that preserve deterministic headless tests.

  mapped exposure and observed Engine/Runtime authority transactions.
- [x] Add one smoke that proves backend discovery can fail closed without
  affecting protocol authority or WM IPC contracts.
- [x] Add a live backend dependency policy before adding crates that touch
  `/dev/dri`, `/dev/input`, GBM, EGL, DMA-BUF, or real MIT-SHM mapping.

  `sophia-renderer-live` has deterministic fake coverage.

  failure.

  capability probes and per-frame failed imports.

  degraded runtime observation.

  data before introducing a real crate.

## Deferred / Prototype Reference

These items are useful evidence from the XLibre-centered prototype, but they are
not the long-term target architecture.

- [x] Kept SHM routed input deferred because repeated routed-input stress did
  not exceed the documented optimization threshold.
- [x] Keep XLibre routed-input extension docs as a compatibility lesson.
- [x] Keep XComposite/Damage bridge smokes as reference tests until Sophia X
  Authority has equivalent transaction tests.
- [x] Keep XLibre namespace smoke as isolation evidence until Sophia X
  Authority namespace enforcement has live coverage.
- [x] Keep the documented Sophia X11 WM Bridge as a stopgap for reusing legacy
  tiling WMs without weakening the native blind WM IPC boundary.

---

## Completed Milestones

- [x] Milestone 4 X11 buffer and presentation semantics: standard DRI3 1.2 and
  Present feed renderer-private DMA-BUF/fence ownership, mixed CPU/GPU
  composition, Engine-prepared commits, KMS page-flip completion, Complete
  before Idle, and exact teardown. Retained paired X13 software and Vulkan
  evidence passes controlled acquire delay and rejection recovery without a
  private presentation extension.

- [x] Protocol-neutral authority boundary: Engine routed input now targets
  `SurfaceId`, visual layers carry `AuthorityLocalId`, and Engine source has no
  XLibre, X-window, Wayland, Smithay, or Kitty types. XLibre wire encoding is
  confined to its opt-in historical adapter.
- [x] Sophia Wayland Authority foundation: a frontend-only Smithay authority
  owns private sockets, client namespaces, compositor/xdg resources, ordered
  surface reducers, SHM snapshots, output advertisement, seat delivery, frame
  callbacks, buffer releases, and bounded DMA-BUF negotiation.
- [x] First native Kitty transaction proof: Kitty 0.47.4 ran with `DISPLAY`
  removed and software GL, submitted 16 changing nonzero SHM frames through the
  Sophia Wayland Authority, and completed without an X server process.
- [x] XLibre runtime retirement: release builds and the installed launcher use
  native Wayland; the XLibre bridge has no live feature and is isolated under
  `research/xlibre`, outside the workspace and production dependency graph.

- [x] Pointer and multi-output presentation: QEMU proved physical keyboard and
  pointer routing, independent content on two KMS outputs, per-output
  page-flip pacing, and clean retirement. DRM VRR discovery and fullscreen
  policy are implemented; activation proof remains deferred for capable
  hardware.
- [x] XLibre Kitty compatibility proof: a real Kitty X11/GLX client produced
  readable pixels through software GL and XComposite/MIT-SHM capture, accepted
  physical keyboard input including terminal navigation keys, met the bounded
  presentation-latency gate, and recovered successfully through the independent
  Ctrl-Alt-Backspace guard.
- [x] Generic legacy-WM bridge core: opaque layout snapshots, validated Engine
  commits, resizable Xterm transactions, configure acknowledgement, focus, and
  injected-input pixel change passed headless coverage. Remaining dedicated-TTY
  and second-WM demonstrations are deferred rather than architecture blockers.

- [x] Added the first `sophia-live-session --terminal=xterm` one-shot bootstrap
  around xterm authority transactions and deterministic composition lifecycle.
- [x] Split X11 Authority socket binding and serving into reusable one-client
  and persistent sequential entry points with authority state shared across
  accepted connections.
- [x] Proved the xterm request stream reaches committed drawing transactions;
  this evidence is now classified accurately as a transaction proof rather
  than an inspectable-pixel proof.

- [x] Engine-centered authority reframe: README, architecture docs, atomic
  rendering invariant, and XLibre prototype/reference status.
- [x] Data-oriented design and style rules, including domain-first file
  cohesion guidance.
- [x] Phase 0-2: repository shape, Rust skeleton, protocol/data model, and
  headless engine.
- [x] Phase 3-4: XLibre mirror probe, XComposite/Damage capture, CPU readback,
  and first X11 surface in headless frames.
- [x] Phase 5-6.5: blind WM protocol, bounded IPC codec, external WM demo,
  routed-input XLibre patch, and smoke/stress coverage.
- [x] Phase 7-8: portal reducers, compositor chrome action reducer, and polite
  X11 close helper.
- [x] Phase 9: process supervisor, restart policy, WM restart adapter, and last
  committed layout cache.
- [x] Session runtime assembly: runtime reducer, bounded observation intake,
  headless session driver, broker health/control packets, and live X/WM socket
  smoke.
- [x] Portal execution prototype: X11 `SelectionRequest` conversion, native
  denial, approved bounded text handoff, and live X smoke.
- [x] Portal request/grant lifecycle: bounded pending and active state,
  deadlines, completion, expiry, disconnect and executor revocation,
  source-generation validation, and broker-restart invalidation.
- [x] Native same-namespace selection handshake: per-client routing for core
  `SelectionRequest` and restricted `SelectionNotify` SendEvent, with a
  two-client socket proof and connection-local event sequences.
- [x] Protocol-neutral authority transactions: `AuthoritySurface`,
  `SurfaceTransaction`, readiness states, and committed surface projection into
  renderable layers.
- [x] Sophia X Authority design: namespace-scoped resources, event
  subscriptions, synthetic lifecycle, drawing updates, and selection portal
  conversion.
- [x] Sophia X Authority v0 runtime: internal request/response packets, bounded
  codec, reducer-backed runtime, Unix socket helper, and
  `x-authority-runtime-smoke`.
- [x] Sophia X Authority X11 wire start: setup parser, setup success/failure
  encoders, first core request decoder, minimal property table, and setup
  socket smoke.
- [x] Sophia X Authority client-visible output: bounded X error/event records,
  `ConfigureNotify`, `MapNotify`, `PropertyNotify`, `SelectionNotify`, and
  setup/create/map socket smoke.
- [x] Future Wayland Authority boundary documented as a later protocol
  authority, not the architectural center.
- [x] Backend skeletons: frame clock, renderer/import abstraction, DRM/KMS
  discovery, libinput polling, physical input routing, and page-flip timing
  seams.

## 2026-08-16 Multi-Monitor Per-Head Composition Foundation

- [x] Replaced primary-sized mirror composition with one immutable logical
  scene fanned out into a native-size `HeadCompositionPlan`, damage ledger,
  renderer target, framebuffer/import owner, KMS request, callback lane, and
  retirement owner for every opaque physical head. Mirror retirement joins the
  required head set without exposing connector identity to Engine policy or the
  WM.
- [x] Added prepare-all presentation cohorts, callback-only shutdown drain,
  partial-submit poisoning, retryable cleanup, head-loss failure, and typed
  forced-detach evidence. Startup, resume, CPU, retained, DMA-BUF, compositor,
  cursor, and damage paths use the common per-head lowering seam.
- [x] Added live `sophia_output_v1` topology proposals for independently chosen
  modes, scales, transforms, positions, and mixed mirror/extended membership.
  Candidate and rollback resources are prepared before ordered per-card apply;
  published Engine, X, WM, pointer, and input state changes only after every new
  logical output reaches its first-presentation barrier.
- [x] Added bounded authority-owned `SurfaceContentSet` variants and
  `SurfaceRasterRequirements`. X Authority retains a canonical drawable plus
  derived density stores and can replay clear/fill, line, rectangle,
  ImageText8/PolyText8, and same-drawable `CopyArea`; selection reports exact,
  downsampled, and upsampled paths honestly.
- [x] Retained the physical failure archaeology and implementation decisions in
  `docs/research-log.md`. Active work moved to the critical path in `todo.md`;
  `docs/multi-monitor-composition.md` remains the normative contract.

# Admission, ingress and provenance for synthetic input

## Context

[t030](../plans/queue-11-parallel-production-readiness.md) excluded `XTEST` and
said why: it is four requests and cheap to write, but the reference server's is
entirely ungated, and their own notes record that as a known gap -- any client
can drive the pointer and keyboard. Sophia's input is session-owned authority,
so t030 held that synthetic input needs an explicit admission story *before it
exists at all*, and invited a revisit when conformance tooling made that story
worth designing. `xts5` drives the mouse through XTEST, and a physical-acceptance
harness wants it for setup. This is that revisit.

This note settles admission, ingress and provenance. It does not authorise
implementation; it is the contract an implementation would have to satisfy.

## What the shared seat cannot promise

The earlier framing -- that XTEST cannot be namespace-scoped -- was too strong,
and is withdrawn. A virtual seat, or an injector that verifies and bounds every
effect to an admitted namespace, is a coherent design. What is true is narrower:

> The **shared-seat** path cannot promise namespace confinement. Injected input
> follows global focus and grabs, so its effects land wherever those point,
> which may be a window in another namespace.

That is why the shared-seat path is desktop administration in the sense
`docs/scripting.md` defines, and why it is refused by default. It is not a claim
that no scoped design exists. `ClassicShared` membership is not a synthetic-input
grant either: scripting.md separates resource admission from control
authorization, and shared resource access does not imply the right to drive the
seat.

## Admission

**Authorization is per admitted caller, and the global enable is also
necessary.** A global enable makes the capability *available*; it never
authorizes a connected client by itself. Absence of either the enable or the
caller's authorization disables discovery and effects alike.

**Discovery follows authorization.** `ListExtensions` and `QueryExtension` report
XTEST only to a caller authorized for it, and they must agree -- the property
t086 repaired for the rest of the extension set. Absence is the default for an
unavailable capability. Hiding the extension is not a security boundary: a
client that guesses the opcode meets the same denial, and that denial is an
explicit error, never silence or a dropped request.

`BadAccess` is the denial. A client may report an authorization denial and an
absent extension alike as failure, but they are distinguishable on the wire --
`BadAccess` is not `BadRequest` and not `BadImplementation` -- and an
intentionally absent extension is not a defect. What the contract requires is
that the **refusal record** separate intentional authorization denial from
missing implementation, so the log answers which one happened.

### The authorization boundary is atomic, not a check followed by work

A check, then an enqueue, still races revocation; so does a check followed by a
focus, seat or security-epoch change. Authorized work binds to the **admitted
connection, the grant generation, the session, and the seat and security
epoch**, and there is a single authoritative commit boundary shared with
revocation:

- work not committed at that boundary when revocation takes effect does not run;
- effects already committed are not retroactively undone;
- focus, grab resolution and security validation are coherent at that boundary;
- no reconnect, and no reuse of a client or resource identifier, inherits an
  earlier grant's pending input.

**Cleanup outlives the grant.** Retiring a revoked caller's contribution must
remain possible after injection permission is gone, and when the ordinary queue
is full. Cleanup that depends on the path being available is cleanup that fails
exactly when it is needed.

## Ingress

**Synthetic input joins shared authoritative routing through an explicitly
synthetic ingress.** Session authorizes; Engine remains the input authority.
`FakeInput` must not write client events directly, because that steps around
committed focus, active grabs, the security epoch, input recovery, and lock and
VT policy. It does **not** follow that synthetic input impersonates a libinput
device: the protocol requires shared routing, not a forged device identity.

`crates/sophia-session/src/live_session/owner_loop/input_proof.rs` injects
through the committed Engine path and *asserts* it traversed committed focus.
That is precedent that the ingress constraint is satisfiable. It is not a
general XTEST grant, and its single-source release helper is not proof that
multi-source cleanup works.

**Reserved session actions default to refusal.** Whether this grant may invoke
VT switches, emergency chords, or anything with locked or inactive-seat
behaviour is a separate question from whether it may inject a keystroke.
Anything requiring physical presence or separate authority is refused unless
explicitly granted.

**A delay blocks one client, not the server.** `FakeInput`'s time field is a
delay, not a timestamp, and it constrains the processing order of that
*client's* subsequent requests. During it, revocation, cleanup, healthy peers
and physical input all continue. A later X reply is not by itself proof that a
recipient received anything or that anything was presented.

## Provenance and cleanup

**Provenance is enforced runtime state, not an evidence label.** Synthetic input
carries a synthetic identity that the runtime acts on, and it is never promoted
into something indistinguishable from a physical gesture. `source=synthetic` in
the existing path is the precedent for saying so in evidence; the contract needs
the state itself.

**Synthetic input does not close a physical obligation.** It may drive setup and
supply explicitly labelled regression evidence. It cannot substitute for the
physical evidence required by t077, t060 or t062: it
establishes nothing about hardware or libinput delivery, physical timing, VT
behaviour, or recovery through the original device path. Before a physical phase
begins, retire synthetic contributions under the cleanup rules below and settle
outstanding work, and keep the two phases and their provenance separately
identifiable in the record.

**Cleanup retires a contribution, it does not release the seat.** This is where
the naive reading is actively unsafe. If the operator physically holds Shift,
injector A also injects Shift-down, and A is revoked, cleanup must leave the
physical hold intact. The same holds when a second injector B holds it too.

So the contract requires **source-owned contribution tracking**: each source's
contribution to a key, button or modifier is held separately, with a stated
policy for overlap and for duplicate transitions. Retiring A removes A's
contribution.

The prohibition is on an *unconditional* release, not on releases as such.
Cleanup must not issue an unconditional seat-wide key or button release, remove
another source's held contribution, or arbitrarily cancel another client's grab.
But where retiring a source changes the aggregate logical state -- the retired
source was the last holder -- authority-owned reconciliation may produce the
necessary release transition and the corresponding recipient cleanup, under the
established target, lease and epoch rules. A delivered release necessarily
changes that recipient's protocol state; that is the point of it. What it must
not do is retarget that cleanup into a new user action on whatever window
currently has focus. The overlap and duplicate-transition policy defines this
behaviour.

Forbidding every release would recreate the stuck key this rule exists to
prevent.

**Injector-owned state and target-side state are different things.** A caller's
own `GrabControl` server-grab imperviousness is its to retire. A passive grab
that its injection *activated* inside a target client belongs to that client;
the implementation must specify how that recovers rather than cancelling
another client's grab.

## The other three requests

`GetVersion` is a version handshake, answerable wherever the extension is
advertised at all.

`CompareCursor` splits. With an explicit cursor and window it is a
resource-scoped question, answerable within the caller's namespace. Asking about
the **current** cursor is a disclosure question about what the seat is
displaying, and needs its own check or an admitted virtual-seat reading.

`GrabControl` makes the calling client **impervious to server grabs**. It does
not release pointer or keyboard grabs and does not grant injection. Gating it
with the administrative surface is defensible, but its actual scheduling
semantics must be implemented and tested rather than stubbed. Neither request
may report behaviour the server does not perform.

## Settled here, and deliberately not settled here

Settled: default absence; the global enable and per-caller authorization are
both necessary; discovery agrees with authorization; the atomic commit boundary
and its revocation semantics; synthetic ingress through shared authoritative
routing; provenance as runtime state; source-owned cleanup; corrected
`GrabControl` and `CompareCursor` readings; and the physical-evidence rule.

**Open implementation-admission gates.** These are named, not decided, and an
implementation is not admitted until each is chosen:

- **Grant issuance and binding.** Who issues a synthetic-input authorization,
  and what it binds to. "Derived from verified admission" does not say.
- **Permission scope.** Whether injection, current-cursor disclosure and
  server-grab imperviousness are separate permissions or one explicitly bundled
  grant.
- **Delegation boundary.** Whether the mode trusts the whole host-user domain or
  delegates selectively, named explicitly either way. Matching UID or
  `ClassicShared` membership is not that boundary.
- **Bounds.** The delay bound, per-client and aggregate queue bounds, what
  happens on overflow, and fairness between callers. Requiring a contract to
  state a bound is not a bound.
- **Reserved actions.** Which session actions, if any, the grant may reach.

## Consequences

Default remains absence, as t030 decided. What changes is that there is a
contract to satisfy and a named list of what remains unchosen.

An implementation admitted under this note owes independent manifest cases for
enabled, disabled, unauthorized and revoked callers in both byte orders, and
these negatives specifically:

- physical and synthetic holding the same key, with the synthetic source
  retired, proving the physical hold survives;
- two injectors holding the same key, with one retired, proving the other
  survives;
- a sole synthetic holder revoked or disconnected, proving the aggregate and
  recipient state clear with no stuck key or button;
- revocation landing on delayed input at the commit boundary;
- a reconnected client, or a reused identifier, not inheriting pending input;
- cleanup succeeding while the ordinary queue is exhausted;
- healthy peers and physical input continuing throughout a delayed caller's block.

XTS results stay separate from physical acceptance records.

Nothing here authorises writing the extension. It states what writing it would
have to honour, and what still has to be decided first.

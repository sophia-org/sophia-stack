# Connection-pinned device negotiation and bounded renderer refresh

## Result

The server implementation slice of [t069](../plans/6tewvlbh-universal-device-negotiation-across-sophia-clients.md)
landed in signed checkpoints `92d1f3ea` and `978d858a`. This records implementation
and deterministic/offscreen validation, not completion of the normal-launch
physical exit.

The frontend pins a connection to one immutable device/capability/allocator
bundle. New bundles affect new connections; old backings keep their originating
provider through final release. A refusing provider no longer prevents releases
owned by healthy providers. DRI3 1.3 device hints and generation-checked window
preferences remain advisory and preserve connection-specific screen modifiers.

The session prepares replacement bundles outside its owner loop and reconciles
exact inventory and acknowledgement generations. Inventory replay is idempotent,
failed observations retry, and auxiliary-device changes refresh renderer sources
without reconstructing output contexts or retained images. The renderer attempts
actual-FD direct import before fallback, retains source contexts, and reuses at
most three internal linear bridges after destination GPU completion. Unfinished
workers occupy a bounded registry without blocking owner teardown.

The current contracts are in [architecture](../../architecture.md),
[frontend negotiation](../../sophia-x-authority.md), and
[pixmap export ownership](../../pixmap-texture-exports.md). No application names,
browser flags or toolkit policy were added to Engine, renderer or frontend.

## Validation

`SOPHIA_FIRST_FRAME_REQUIRE_AUX=1 cargo xtask check` passed on the implementation
candidate. It covers all-feature workspace tests and clippy, formatting, layout,
profile and reader checks, archive regression fixtures, hardware buffer-age
pixel equivalence, and GLX/EGL first-frame and pixmap-export pixels. Retained log:
`.artifacts/t069-validation/xtask-check.log`; candidate identity:
`.artifacts/t069-validation/candidate.json`.

Focused tests exercise immutable connection pins, cross-connection backing
ownership, release retry fairness, stale window preferences, overtaken bundle
preparation/install acknowledgements, inventory retry, worker saturation and
unfinished predecessor retention. Pixel tests exercise transfer, alpha over a
white background and retained images after context replacement. These are
private offscreen tests; none establishes physical hotplug acceptance.

An optimized benchmark captured 600 changing 1920x1080 images for each XR24/AR24
and GPU-direction pair: 2,400 exact pixel checks passed between renderD128 and
renderD129. Host capture p95 ranged from 3.086 to 4.068 ms; the largest capture
was 7.167 ms. Each pair allocated one internal bridge and reused it for all 600
warm captures. Capture timing excludes CPU source preparation and does not
measure display latency. The additional readback timing includes test composition
and readback and is not a presentation metric.

The benchmark log, binary digest, source manifest and summary are retained under
`.artifacts/t069-renderer-transfer/`. The measured source differs from `978d858a`
only in rustfmt ordering of native renderer module declarations; the final
repository gate rebuilt and checked the committed implementation. Earlier debug
baseline runs lack an exact source/binary manifest and support no release-profile
speedup claim.

## Bounds and remaining acceptance

A same-layout foreign-to-local GPU fixture could not be constructed on this
host. Direct-first ordering is pinned through the production policy helper,
while hardware transfer checks use the actual incompatible layouts. Cached idle
bridge storage remains charged to the image budget until replacement or inventory
refresh; it can cause a bounded refusal near that budget.

The [t069 exit](../plans/6tewvlbh-universal-device-negotiation-across-sophia-clients.md#scope-and-exit)
still requires normal unmodified clients without device overrides and physical
device-loss/recovery evidence. A client-internal import failure before submitting
a buffer is outside the server's transfer boundary. The working launch adapter
and installed session were not changed by this checkpoint.

SuboptimalCopy remains disabled. The [five conditions](../plans/6tewvlbh-universal-device-negotiation-across-sophia-clients.md#suboptimalcopy-gate)
are tracked in t070–t074; a sufficient exact alternate-layout flip proof precedes
opt-in plumbing and deduplication. Failed TEST_ONLY and IN_FORMATS absence alone
do not establish that counterfactual.

## Paired-layout implementation

The subsequent [atomic evidence checkpoint](../investigations/qfg6mjp2-atomic-test-history-is-not-alternate-layout-flip-proof.md#consecutive-candidate-tests-after-1b7c84c8)
retains an exact original allocation through bounded fallback rendering and
issues fresh paired TEST_ONLY requests against current state. It reuses the
ordinary rendered alternative, keeps temporary cleanup independent and serviced
while idle, and repairs composition fallback after early PRIME/AddFB refusal.
Its full repository gate and hardware pixel checks pass; physical paired-scanout
and copied-transaction attribution remain separate. Evidence and final candidate
identity are in `.artifacts/t070-paired-layout/`; the live release was not changed.

## Installed playback observation

Mason installed `76ed2fddf31a` and reported Brave Origin open with video playing
in session `00000001788951558950-1cb15054-f8c5-4096-b573-a10d6c7acbcd` on
2026-09-09. The session manifest and live Sophia executables match that release.
The recorder was running with zero discarded records and storage errors;
completed frame retirements continued during the observation.

The browser and GPU process both retained
`--render-node-override=/dev/dri/renderD128`. This accepts the reported playback
on the new installed candidate with the existing override. It does not establish
normal launch behavior without the adapter, hardware video decoding, or device
loss/recovery. Browser stderr was `/dev/null`, so no browser error-log result is
claimed. Retained diagnostic facts are in
`.artifacts/t069-validation/installed-76ed2fdd-observation.json`.

## Device-aware window preference correction

The subsequent native reference review identified a narrower allocation-advice
problem. Sophia intersected output modifiers with the connection's screen set,
but equal tiled modifier numbers did not establish that both devices were the
same. A missing client hint left that distinction untested. niri's native
feedback builder explicitly restricts cross-device scanout preferences to LINEAR
while retaining the ordinary rendering fallback.

The correction caches server-observed render-node filesystem device, inode and
device number in the immutable connection bundle and output preference snapshot.
Only equal available identities permit tiled preferences. Missing or different
identity permits LINEAR only where both measured sets already contain it.
Client hints can further restrict that result. Inconsistent identity/device-number
snapshots are rejected before replacing accepted preferences. Screen formats and
actual submitted-buffer import remain unchanged; no advice asserts that atomic
scanout will succeed.

The contrary-path review also found that resolving a held card's device number
through current sysfs alone could associate an old KMS group with a new node.
Inventory refresh occurs before topology-notice handling, and topology preparation
can defer that notice, so ordering does not exclude the interval. Physical
mapping therefore revalidates both held card and render-node identities around
sysfs resolution; missing or replaced nodes yield no output preference. This is
inventory-time metadata work, not per-query discovery or GPU work.

The [native feedback model](../plans/6tewvlbh-universal-device-negotiation-across-sophia-clients.md#native-feedback-model-and-reference-boundaries)
records reference identities and the mapping to Sophia's native X11 boundaries.
The separate [protocol comparison](../investigations/uqnx2t2b-brave-gpu-restarts-after-va-buffers-fail-gbm-import.md#native-wayland-and-x11-comparison-on-2026-09-09)
shows successful native Wayland browser playback with internally propagated
device selection, and the same client-internal failure through two X11 server
implementations. Native XLibre was reviewed as source, not run. The overall
no-override and physical device-loss exits remain open.

Validation on the correction based on `40161f42` passed
`SOPHIA_FIRST_FRAME_REQUIRE_AUX=1 cargo xtask check`: all-feature workspace tests
and Clippy, conformance/reader/archive checks, hardware buffer-age pixel
equivalence, and GLX/EGL first-frame and pixmap-export pixels. The source was
unchanged during that successful gate. The initial gate stopped at export-order
formatting; the corrected file was checked by the successful full run.

Focused regressions passed: eleven DRI3 capability tests, five window-allocation
tests, one real-socket identity/connection-lifetime regression, one session
identity-propagation test and four held-device mapping tests. The socket test
also proves that repeated queries do not call the provider's identity callback.
The mapping tests inject metadata changes on either side of resolution; they
are deterministic identity tests, not physical hotplug acceptance.

The exact candidate manifest, focused logs and successful full-gate log are
retained in `.artifacts/t069-window-device-preferences/`. Browser source and launch configuration were unchanged.


## Alternate layout ownership through retirement

The checkpoint based on `b20c5fe4` carries a paired scanout comparison through
its actual accepted alternative and exact physical retirement, then through
committed copied-Present settlement. It fixes queued completions reading a later
head's content, and the quiet callback path clearing identity before retirement.
Native topology/owner invalidation survives numeric-generation rollback.

The ordinary fallback can prefer the original format before drawing; unavailable
optional target admission preserves normal rendering. Actual format governs
proof and target reuse, so removing the preference does not allocate another
compatible target. The renderer adds no extra completed render or copy.

The full repository/GPU gate passed with unchanged Rust sources. Thirty new
tests include the separately enabled 18-render GPU pixel/cache test. Evidence,
source hashes and the signed candidate identity are in
`.artifacts/t070-retired-layout/`; the
[investigation](../investigations/qfg6mjp2-atomic-test-history-is-not-alternate-layout-flip-proof.md#alternative-ownership-through-retirement-after-b20c5fe4)
records the exact guarantees and review corrections.

This does not emit SuboptimalCopy or close the task. The presenting connection's
current effective preferences, physical paired-test/flip acceptance and the
normal no-adapter client exit remain separate gates. No installation or live
session restart was performed.

## Exact-format preferences and unavailable devices

The checkpoint based on `cf8188cd` extends the native allocation-preference
pattern to independent XR24 and AR24 rows. It preserves the renderer's allocation
policy and intersects each row with the requesting connection's pinned catalog.
An unavailable bundle now removes window preferences, including LINEAR, without
redirecting the connection or changing its screen inventory. The resolver borrows
the cached lists and uses bounded binary-search membership under the authority
lock. The [investigation](../investigations/qfg6mjp2-atomic-test-history-is-not-alternate-layout-flip-proof.md#exact-format-preference-publication-after-cf8188cd)
records source/reference evidence, seven new tests and the real read-only plane
query. The full repository/GPU gate passed on unchanged Rust sources; the manifest
and logs are in `.artifacts/t070-exact-format-preferences/`. The completion/preference
join and physical acceptance remain open. No install or live-session restart
was performed.

## Retired comparisons against current preferences

The checkpoint based on `820f7694` joins exact copied-Complete evidence with
current native and frontend allocation state. Nonrepeating native context
generations reject reconstruction and rollback reuse. The frontend retains the
successful Present's original subject, then compares current mapping, geometry,
device availability and exact-format effective membership before consuming its
completion. Busy or stale state suppresses only the optional match; ordinary
Copy, completion clocks and Idle remain unchanged. Both normal feedback drains
carry the comparison. No wire mode changes.

The native review also fixed plane-format snapshots becoming detached from their
physical heads during sorting. Head records now own those capabilities. The
[investigation](../investigations/qfg6mjp2-atomic-test-history-is-not-alternate-layout-flip-proof.md#current-preference-comparison-after-820f7694)
records the ownership, current-state checks, twenty-two new tests and remaining
physical gate. The full repository/GPU gate passed on 31 unchanged Rust files.
Source hashes, validation logs and signed candidate identity are
retained in `.artifacts/t070-completion-preferences/`. No installation or
live-session restart was performed; t069/t070 remain open.

## Controlled physical evidence tooling

The checkpoint based on `41ab89f9` adds a generic explicit-layout DRI3 client and
a bounded evidence reader. Actual allocation metadata, exact source/transaction
identities and current native/preference generations connect the paired tests to
the probe's received Copy completion. No rendering or wire-mode policy changes.

Reader and process-deadline tests pass; the private GPU test checks XR24 and AR24
allocations without mapping or presenting. Two small authorized live probes each
completed four Copy/Idle pairs on the old installed `76ed2fdd` session. The
[investigation](../investigations/qfg6mjp2-atomic-test-history-is-not-alternate-layout-flip-proof.md#controlled-allocation-and-evidence-collection-after-41ab89f9)
records evidence and limits. Candidate identity and logs are retained in
`.artifacts/t070-physical-probe/`. The full repository/GPU gate passed on
13 unchanged source/tool files. A qualifying physical pair on the new owner
remains the acceptance gate; no install or session restart was performed.

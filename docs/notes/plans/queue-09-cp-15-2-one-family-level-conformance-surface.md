# CP-15.2 — One family-level conformance surface

This plan retains the scope, constraints, and task details from the roadmap
cutover. Task status and order live only in [todo.md](../../../todo.md)
and the [monthly completion history](../../../done.md). Follow the
[work-tracking contract](../../work-tracking.md).
Historical candidate identities in the details require revalidation before use.

[Parent scope](queue-01-critical-path.md).



## t023

Add one canonical conformance entry point that invokes every role's
retained valid, malformed, codec, and lifecycle corpus.


Required exit:

- a contributor can validate the family without discovering role-specific
  scripts or treating generators and Rust crates as the specification;
- every stable role retains an immutable old-client compatibility gate;
- every stable role has a complete non-Rust lifecycle client implemented from
  normative prose and checked-in schemas; and
- shell stabilization specifically retains the independent C proof and Narthex's
  independent Nim proof without linking Sophia crates or generated bindings.

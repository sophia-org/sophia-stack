# 2026-07-12: Installed-Session Input Recovery Interlock

Historical source, not a current status claim. <a href="../../../history/research-log-2026-09-06.txt">Original snapshot</a>,
lines 7484–7544. The heading supplies the recorded date.

<!-- BEGIN IMPORTED BODY -->

The first installed Kitty operator run exposed a control-plane failure: scanout
reached a visible terminal, but normal keyboard delivery failed and the session
had no reliable local escape. The wrapper had stopped `keyd`, placed the TTY in
graphics/raw mode, and disabled XLibre VT switching while relying on the same
live input path for `exit`. A reboot then removed the runtime-directory logs.

The installed launcher now refuses graphics takeover until a separate libinput
guard observes one complete Ctrl-Alt-Backspace chord. A second chord requests a
graceful in-session exit without depending on focus, then lets the independent
guard force bounded wrapper cleanup if the live loop is wedged. Session groups
and XLibre receive TERM followed by a bounded KILL fallback; KD mode, termios,
and the previous `keyd` state are restored afterward. Full Ctrl-Alt-Fn switching
remains deferred until Sophia owns a correct VT/DRM suspend-and-resume cycle.

The input path now emits privacy-safe one-shot stages for poller readiness,
committed focus, observed keys, authority routing, and XTEST injection. Bounded
synthetic text also traverses Engine focus and evdev mapping instead of entering
the authority channel directly. Logs retain the latest and previous run in the
user state directory so a reboot does not erase the failing seam. The dedicated
TTY physical typing and deliberately wedged-session recovery run remain the
hardware acceptance gate.

Guard bring-up also exposed that libinput's path context can reject stable
`/dev/input/by-path` aliases before invoking Sophia's open callback. Native
input admission now canonicalizes configured absolute paths and honors the
requested read/write access mode without logging either path. The rebuilt QEMU
guest passes the 300-tick dual-output gate with all 14 keyboard events routed,
five pointer events routed, changed pixels, 112 native submissions, clean
retirement, and no callback rejection or cleanup debt.

The isolated recovery scenario now exercises the guard contract directly with
a virtio keyboard: one complete Ctrl-Alt-Backspace chord arms the independent
guard, a second chord triggers both the guard and the live loop, and both
virtual outputs drain with no in-flight scanout or cleanup debt before poweroff.
This is deliberately not recorded as host VT restoration evidence. A separate
same-build rerun of the default physical-text QEMU scenario routed all 14 key
events but timed out waiting for the expected xterm pixel change, so that
content regression remains open independently of the recovery gate.

The first guarded physical-TTY rerun then proved the interlock on hardware: the
first chord armed before takeover and the second returned to the text TTY
without rebooting. Persistent logs showed physical poller readiness, committed
focus, observed and routed keys, and XTEST injection, but Kitty received no
usable input. The installed XTEST protocol definition identifies the stopped
seam: FakeInput's `time` field is a delivery delay in milliseconds, while the
adapter had supplied libinput's monotonic event timestamp. The compatibility
injector now requests zero-delay delivery and synchronously checks each XTEST
request instead of treating a queued unchecked request as successful.

That hardware rerun also exposed the compatibility renderer's full-frame cost:
45 frames in 25.9 seconds, 8.74 MB read and hashed per frame, a 397 ms libinput
lag warning, and a maximum 798 ms submit-to-page-flip interval. The live bridge
now maintains X Damage trackers and a CPU-buffer base, emits one clipped packed
patch per damaged surface, and falls back to replacement only for initial,
resized, missing-base, or at-least-half-surface updates. XTEST uses an
independent connection and worker so capture cannot block channel draining.
The optimized dummy-XLibre proof presented routed xterm input in 17 ms with
three steady patches, 1.26 MB total readback, and a 9 ms maximum capture.

# 2026-07-11: Isolated Virtio-GPU Session Evidence

Historical source, not a current status claim. <a href="../../../history/research-log-2026-09-06.txt">Original snapshot</a>,
lines 7545–7571. The heading supplies the recorded date.

<!-- BEGIN IMPORTED BODY -->

Sophia now has a direct-kernel QEMU initramfs builder and a headless session
harness. The guest has no storage or network device, uses serial control and an
unconnected Unix-domain VNC display sink, and owns emulated virtio-gpu and
virtio-keyboard devices. It starts udev, mounts devpts, launches real xterm,
opens the virtual input nodes through libinput, and runs persistent native
scanout for an exact `--max-ticks=300` budget without host DRM or VT access.

The passing run completed 300 session ticks, 42 native submissions, 41 steady
retirements, 41 accepted page-flip callbacks, two nonzero terminal exports,
injected terminal pixel change, and zero submit failures, retire failures,
rejected callbacks, saturated callback queues, in-flight frames, or cleanup
debt. The strict verifier accepted `/tmp/sophia-qemu-session.log`.

Guest bring-up exposed two real cross-driver defects. AddFB2 fallback passed a
linear modifier while clearing `DRM_MODE_FB_MODIFIERS`, which violated the DRM
crate's flag/value invariant; the implicit fallback now wraps the same planes
with `modifier=None`. Virtio-gpu also reports repeated zero page-flip sequence
values. Native CRTC routes now normalize driver values into strictly increasing
Sophia-local serials, preserving stale-event rejection across repeated values
and 32-bit sequence wrap. Focused regressions cover both fixes.

The guest virtual keyboard is present and opens through libinput, but the
current proof uses Sophia's bounded X key injection for the pixel-change check.
QMP-driven virtual-key input remains the next isolated input proof.

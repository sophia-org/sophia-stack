<!-- BEGIN IMPORTED BODY -->

The xterm compatibility stream currently reaches `ImageText8`, emits four
ready `SurfaceTransaction` values, commits them through runtime, and passes the
deterministic composition/scanout lifecycle proof. Core drawing now updates
bounded XRGB8888 software buffers, renderer-live composes those bytes, and the
native EGL adapter can upload the composed frame into a GBM front buffer.
The TTY3 content proof now exports an exact composed xterm checksum through the
native GL/GBM path, submits that buffer to KMS, observes accepted page-flip
retirement, and drains cleanup. Requested and exported checksum evidence match;
the remaining presentation work is persistent-session ownership, not pixel
upload correctness.

The active milestone is therefore persistent session ownership, hardware
terminal-content presentation, and physical keyboard delivery. Injected core
key events already produce changed pixels in a real xterm. Pixel bytes remain
outside Sophia Engine and the blind WM protocol.

The persistent launcher now owns an explicit local display, one xterm, the X
Authority server, one live backend runtime, and the latest composed CPU scene.
A bounded real-xterm run passes repeated authority/runtime ticks and injected
pixel change. Building it exposed and fixed static drawing generations: X
Authority now advances a window generation after each emitted visual
transaction, so long-running Engine commits remain contiguous. Native scanout
now joins this owner behind `--native-scanout`: the same loop queues composed
CPU frames for GL/GBM export, polls native page flips, retires tracked KMS
submissions, and drains cleanup. Reduced schema 6 evidence records successful
submits, deferrals and failures, submit-to-page-flip latency, maximum in-flight
age, callback pressure, nonzero exports, authority drops, and cleanup debt.
The non-native repeated-xterm regression and strict verifier fixtures pass.

The strict persistent hardware proof now passes. Corrected counters first
exposed River ownership and then two real lifetime defects: the runtime retired
the newly displayed framebuffer instead of the previously displayed one, and
the shutdown loop retired a frame while immediately submitting another. The
persistent mode now performs a blocking initial modeset without waiting for an
event, retains the displayed owner until a later accepted page flip replaces
it, and has a retire-only idle/shutdown path. A 30-second TTY3 run completed 46
submissions with 45 steady retirements, six nonzero exports, zero dropped
authority batches, zero rejected callbacks, zero transition failures, and no
in-flight or cleanup debt. A subsequent bounded run also reports nonzero
submit-to-page-flip latency after fixing timestamp association.

Host iteration remains unnecessarily disruptive because River must release the
only DRM card. The next stability harness should boot Sophia in a headless QEMU
guest with `virtio-gpu`, serial control, virtual keyboard input, and no guest
compositor. Use that guest for the 300-tick and repeated-session proofs; retain
the AMD TTY run for final driver and modifier evidence.

Physical keyboard plumbing now enters the persistent owner through explicit
libinput event nodes. `InputFocusState` in Sophia Engine validates a seat's
focused surface against committed visual state before X Authority maps evdev
keycodes and modifiers to core events. The TTY keyboard node opens in a bounded
run, but the noninteractive validation process observed zero physical events;
an operator typing run is still the evidence gate.

Wayland was gated behind the operator-grade X session. Before considering it,
Sophia would connect the live session to the documented generic X11 WM bridge. The
bridge is an embedded minimal X server with synthetic windows; a configured
legacy WM is layout policy only and receives no physical input, raw metadata,
namespaces, or real client XIDs. Sophia Engine speaks only its generic WM IPC
and does not know which legacy WM the bridge supervises.

The xmonad source is cloned at `~/src/xmonad` commit `a9a8b5c` as the first
compatibility reference. It is not vendored and is not a Sophia runtime
dependency. The embedded server and real two-window xmonad process proof pass.
The remaining gate is to feed opaque live-session surface snapshots through the
same generic bridge socket and apply validated proposals to presented surfaces.

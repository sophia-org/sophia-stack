# 2026-07-11: Readable And Resizable Xmonad Session Path

Historical source, not a current status claim. <a href="../../../history/research-log-2026-09-06.txt">Original snapshot</a>,
lines 7655–7676. The heading supplies the recorded date.

<!-- BEGIN IMPORTED BODY -->

The first physical xmonad attempt exposed that the earlier pixel-change proof
was not a visual proof: unimplemented core drawing painted damage bounds white,
and the partial fixed glyph table rendered ordinary punctuation as question
marks. The operator stopped the session without treating that run as milestone
evidence.

X Authority now preserves GC raster values, executes the xterm-used text,
fill, line, clear, copy, and image paths against bounded XRGB buffers, and
covers printable ASCII in its deterministic fixed raster. The real-xterm smoke
scans materialized pixels for the expected `Sophia` glyph sequence and reports
`ascii_marker_match=true`; nonzero bytes alone no longer pass it.

CPU drawing publication now distinguishes full replacements from tightly
packed damage patches. Resize keeps a buffer handle's generation monotonic,
publishes one correctly sized replacement, and applies later patches in order.
With fixed size constraints removed, the real-xmonad headless session completes
one configure acknowledgement, commits the resized layout and focus, and
observes changed pixels after injected input without authority backpressure.
The dedicated-TTY visual rerun remains the final gate.

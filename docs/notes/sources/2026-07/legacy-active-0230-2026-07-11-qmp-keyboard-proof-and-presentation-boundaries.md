# 2026-07-11: QMP Keyboard Proof And Presentation Boundaries

Historical source, not a current status claim. <a href="../../../history/research-log-2026-09-06.txt">Original snapshot</a>,
lines 7694–7725. The heading supplies the recorded date.

<!-- BEGIN IMPORTED BODY -->

The isolated session no longer uses Sophia's internal core-X key injector for
its input claim. The guest announces readiness only after xterm pixels and
Engine-owned focus are stable. The host then sends `sophia` and Return through
QMP `input-send-event`, virtio-keyboard, the kernel input path, libinput, Engine
focus validation, and X Authority. The passing run observed and routed all 14
press/release events, changed later xterm pixels, completed exactly 300 session
ticks, submitted 46 native frames, retired 45 steady page flips, and drained
without rejected callbacks, failed transitions, or cleanup debt. Tick counting
pauses for a bounded five-second physical-input window so readiness at the last
scheduled tick cannot race QMP delivery.

The guest also exposes virtio-mouse and libinput maps pointer events to a
separate Engine device ID. The completed pointer slice performs QMP word
selection in the typed xterm. Five motion/button events pass through libinput,
Engine surface-only hit-testing/focus, and core X MotionNotify/Button events;
all five route and a second terminal pixel change is observed. The first drag
attempt exposed that targeting the last mapped X window was insufficient even
though all input reached Engine. Pointer events now carry only the routed
Sophia surface, and X Authority resolves that surface through its internal
surface/window table. This preserves the authority boundary: Engine never
receives or interprets the client XID.

Native presentation now has independent per-output scanout ownership, damage,
frame clocks, in-flight state, and retirement, proved with two QEMU heads. The
physical multi-connector AMD gate remains. Fixed-refresh evidence requires each
output to follow its own page-flip timeline without overlapping submission. VRR
remains a hardware proof gate: the property contract and Engine eligibility
policy exist, default off, but activation and fixed-refresh fallback still need
capable hardware evidence.

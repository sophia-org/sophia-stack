# 2026-07-11: Dual-Output Native Presentation And Fixed-Refresh Vsync

Historical source, not a current status claim. <a href="../../../history/research-log-2026-09-06.txt">Original snapshot</a>,
lines 7744–7785. The heading supplies the recorded date.

<!-- BEGIN IMPORTED BODY -->

The persistent runtime now owns a bounded table of output-scoped frame targets,
callback intake, scanout submissions, displayed buffers, cleanup debt, and
retirement state. Native selection deterministically assigns disjoint
connector/CRTC/primary-plane chains, groups page-flip routes by DRM card, and
supports explicit selections so one card cannot silently resubmit its first
connector for every output.

The isolated QEMU session owns both virtio GPU outputs. Output 1 presents the
terminal while output 2 presents a deterministic Engine proof marker in the
extended desktop region; their checksums must differ. The 300-tick gate requires
nonzero per-output exports, submissions, callbacks, and retirements, plus zero
callback rejection, cleanup debt, overlapping submission, or non-monotonic
page-flip phase. Keyboard and pointer proofs remain mandatory in the same run.

VRR property discovery recognizes connector `VRR_CAPABLE` and CRTC
`VRR_ENABLED`. The Engine decision defaults off and permits enable only for one
opaque, unoccluded fullscreen surface without overlays or required composition.
Atomic page-flip request construction fails closed if VRR is requested without
the enable property. Activation and fallback remain an AMD hardware gate;
virtio-gpu is not accepted as VRR evidence.

The physical VRR gate now has a dedicated two-phase runner and strict reduced
evidence verifier. During implementation, the proof exposed that the native
page-flip builder carried `VRR_ENABLED`, but the modeset branch ignored the
same policy request. Modeset request construction now supports the property and
fails closed when its handle is absent. `tools/vrr_hardware_proof.sh` derives an
Enabled decision for one opaque, unoccluded fullscreen surface and commits
`VRR_ENABLED=true`, then derives an Ineligible decision for an overlay-present
scene and commits the fixed-refresh `false` fallback. It requires presented and
retired callbacks for both phases. The destructive AMD run is still pending
because it must be performed from the dedicated TTY, not the active graphical
session.

`tools/operator_keyboard_hardware_proof.sh` similarly packages the remaining
operator gate without guessing an input node. The operator supplies a stable
`...-event-kbd` path, waits for the physical-input readiness marker, and types
the expected lowercase proof text. Existing persistent-session evidence rejects
the run unless physical keys route through Engine focus and later xterm pixels
change.

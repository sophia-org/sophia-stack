# 2026-07-11: Exact Operator Input Evidence

Historical source, not a current status claim. <a href="../../../history/research-log-2026-09-06.txt">Original snapshot</a>,
lines 7786–7836. The heading supplies the recorded date.

<!-- BEGIN IMPORTED BODY -->

The first AMD operator attempts exposed two proof-harness defects rather than a
new authority boundary. `keyd` exclusively owned the AT keyboard, so opening its
physical event node succeeded while libinput observed zero events. With `keyd`
stopped, Engine routed 27 events, but the original five-second deadline still
expired before a later xterm transaction changed the composed checksum.

The combined helper now detects an active `keyd`, stops it through an explicit
interactive `sudo sv down keyd`, and installs an EXIT trap that restores the
service. It has no separate Enter-to-begin prompt, preventing that confirmation
key from becoming the first exact-proof event.
The physical proof requires exact press/release pairs for the configured
lowercase text plus Return after Engine focus routing and evdev-to-core-X
translation. It gives the operator 15 seconds to complete that bounded sequence,
then starts a separate five-second pixel-settle deadline. The scanned-out xterm
shows the expected input, and readiness is withheld until those nonzero prompt
pixels are page-flip-confirmed on the primary output. Keyboard delivery freezes
after the exact Return release so operator retries cannot weaken the evidence.
Schema 2 input evidence records
expected events, matched events, and the later pixel change. The AMD acceptance
run now passes: all 14 events matched, xterm pixels changed, and the one-output
native session completed 62 submissions, 61 callbacks/retirements, 22 nonzero
exports, and zero overlap, phase, callback, transition, or cleanup failures.

Requiring a nonzero prompt baseline then exposed that the earlier QMP pixel
claim was a false positive: late prompt drawing changed the initial blank frame,
while routed key events still targeted the last mapped top-level X window.
Xterm selects core key events on its VT child through `CWEventMask`. Sophia X
Authority now parses that bounded value from `CreateWindow` and
`ChangeWindowAttributes`, retains the selected X window inside the authority,
and uses the last mapped window only as a fallback. Input readiness also
requires 500 milliseconds of quiescence after nonzero prompt pixels so event
selection cannot race the external sender. A rebuilt strict QEMU run
then matched all 14 events and changed pixels after the fully drawn prompt before
continuing through pointer and dual-output evidence. Raw X window identity never
crosses into Engine or WM state.

The first AMD VRR attempt then exposed a property-name mismatch. The connector
advertises the kernel-standard lowercase `vrr_capable`, while the selected CRTC
does expose uppercase `VRR_ENABLED`. Discovery had searched for uppercase
`VRR_CAPABLE` and therefore rejected capable hardware before building an atomic
request. The lookup now uses `vrr_capable` with the old uppercase spelling kept
only as a compatibility fallback for deterministic fixtures.

Non-destructive inspection after that correction reports connector 100, CRTC
86, `VRR_ENABLED` present, and `vrr_capable=0`. The current eDP panel is not VRR
capable, so activation/fallback evidence cannot be produced on this hardware.
The gate remains open for a connector reporting capability `1`; Sophia does not
override the value or treat a property contract without capability as proof.

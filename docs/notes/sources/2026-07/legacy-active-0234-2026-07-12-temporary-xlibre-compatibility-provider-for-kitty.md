# 2026-07-12: Temporary XLibre Compatibility Provider For Kitty

Historical source, not a current status claim. <a href="../../../history/research-log-2026-09-06.txt">Original snapshot</a>,
lines 7837–7890. The heading supplies the recorded date.

<!-- BEGIN IMPORTED BODY -->

Kitty's installed X11 backend requires XKB and a working OpenGL context, while
Sophia X Authority deliberately does not yet advertise XKB, GLX, DRI3, or
Present. Pretending that Kitty was another core-drawing probe would therefore
produce a launcher that connected but could never render.

The first usable compatibility checkpoint instead reactivates the historical
XLibre bridge as an explicitly temporary protocol authority. XLibre runs on the
dummy video driver with software GL, no physical input devices, no TCP listener,
and a private MIT cookie. A persistent XComposite adapter owns the XIDs and
named pixmaps, converts readbacks into opaque `XLibrePrototype` surface
transactions, and never exposes client identity to Engine or the WM. Engine
continues to own physical input, focus routing, composition, frame scheduling,
and KMS. Core key events return through a bridge-private XTEST adapter until the
Sophia-owned X Authority has native GPU-buffer coverage.

The first real headless run used Kitty 0.47.4 against XLibre 1.25.1.8. It
materialized one 925 KB nonzero Kitty surface. Capture checksum deduplication
reduced a four-second run from 29 repeated batches to six actual pixel changes;
injected `sophia` plus Return then changed the composed checksum and completed
in 2.6 seconds. Native TTY presentation remains the operator gate.

The first installed-session input proof then showed that capture correctness
alone was insufficient: Kitty echoed typed characters several seconds late.
The launcher had used a debug build, the session cloned and repeatedly scanned
each 1280x720 frame, physical input was polled only after rendering, and native
export recreated its EGL/GL setup for every frame. The launcher now runs the
release binary; XLibre sessions acquire libinput on a bounded worker; the main
loop drains input before waiting for X transactions and again before composing;
CPU composition borrows source storage, row-copies clipped spans, and computes
its checksum/nonzero count in one pass; and the native renderer reuses one EGL
context and GL pipeline per output. KMS still receives a fully completed GL
frame because the atomic path does not yet provide an explicit native fence.

Schema 9 records the maximum composition, input-dispatch gap, queue depth and
dwell, upload, and persistent-resource counts. The final Kitty dummy rerun
presents input in 40 milliseconds with 8-millisecond CPU composition and
11-millisecond MIT-SHM capture. The stricter QEMU final-key-to-primary-output
measurement is 37 milliseconds. The dual-output QEMU proof
creates exactly two native targets and pipelines with zero recreations, drains
155 page flips without cleanup debt, and confirms that PRIME GEM cleanup treats
the driver's already-closed `EINVAL` result as idempotent success. Degraded
XGetImage remains operational but is rejected for interactive evidence.

The next operator run exposed a keymap mismatch hidden by ordinary typing.
Sophia correctly translated Linux input codes with the evdev `+8` convention,
but device-less dummy XLibre had selected its legacy `xfree86` keycode table.
Letter positions overlap between those tables; navigation positions do not, so
evdev keycode 111 (`Up`) arrived as `Print`. The private server now loads the
evdev XKB rules before launching a client and fails startup unless Up, Left,
Right, and Down resolve at keycodes 111, 113, 114, and 116. Sophia X Authority's
minimal core map now advertises the same navigation keysyms for direct clients.

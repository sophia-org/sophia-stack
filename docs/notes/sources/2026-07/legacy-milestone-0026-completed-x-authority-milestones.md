<!-- BEGIN IMPORTED BODY -->

- [x] Advanced X window generations after every emitted drawing transaction so
  persistent clients commit contiguous visual updates instead of replaying one
  stale `previous_committed_generation`.
- [x] Added persistent `sophia-live-session` display/xterm ownership with one
  live backend runtime, repeated CPU composition, bounded shutdown, and a real
  injected-input pixel-change regression.
- [x] Added Engine-owned seat focus validation and an explicit libinput-device
  route from reduced physical key packets to X Authority core keyboard events.

- [x] Expand X11 atom/property tables for ICCCM names and metadata-broker
  candidates.
- [x] Add minimal bounded `GetProperty` replies and socket smoke coverage.
- [x] Define and pass the first real-client-library target with `x11rb`: setup,
  atom lookup, create, property write/read, map, and event observation.
- [x] Pass `xdpyinfo` as a broader setup/introspection probe with minimal
  `CreateGC`, `FreeGC`, `GetInputFocus`, `QueryExtension`, `ListExtensions`,
  `QueryBestSize`, full predefined atom, and root-property read support.
- [x] Pass a tiny compiled C Xlib probe covering `XOpenDisplay`,
  `XInternAtom`, `XCreateSimpleWindow`, `XStoreName`, `XChangeProperty`,
  `XGetWindowProperty`, `XMapWindow`, and `XDestroyWindow`.
- [x] Pass a drawing-oriented C Xlib probe using `XFillRectangle`; opcode 70
  now decodes to a ready `CoreDraw` surface transaction.
- [x] Expose live X11 socket dispatch results through an out-of-band observer,
  preserving no-reply success semantics for core draw requests.
- [x] Add socket-level smoke coverage proving `PolyFillRectangle` creates one
  ready `CoreDraw` transaction outside unit-test-only dispatch.
- [x] Feed observed X Authority drawing transactions into the live runtime
  adapter as reduced authority commit summaries.
- [x] Validate the C Xlib drawing smoke through Engine commit and Runtime
  authority transaction counters without leaking XIDs or namespace metadata.
- [x] Add the first bounded software upload request model with core `PutImage`
  decoding into ready CPU-backed surface transactions.
- [x] Pass a compiled C Xlib `XPutImage` smoke through observed transaction,
  Engine commit, and Runtime authority counters with no direct X reply on
  success.
- [x] Add the first Present-style explicit buffer handoff model as private
  `SOPHIA-PRESENT` minor opcode `0` using XPixmap handles.
- [x] Add socket and CLI smoke coverage proving Present-style handoff reaches
  Engine commit and Runtime counters without adding compositor policy.
- [x] Defer DMA-BUF placeholder modeling until real DRI3/Present semantics are
  ready.
- [x] Move the long-running X Authority transaction side channel to a
  runtime-owned bounded queue while keeping callback observers for focused
  tests.
- [x] Document side-channel backpressure: full or disconnected queues fail
  closed instead of allocating unbounded buffers or dropping visual facts.
- [x] Add minimal `MIT-SHM` `QueryExtension` and `ShmQueryVersion` support with
  unsupported minor opcodes failing closed.
- [x] Model `ShmAttach` as namespace-local metadata without mapping host memory.
- [x] Decode `XShmPutImage` and reject it with bounded native X errors until a
  real SHM import path exists.
- [x] Defer real MIT-SHM memory mapping until a compositor backend can consume
  mapped bytes through a bounded renderer import path.
- [x] Add protocol-neutral `AuthorityTransactionIntake` so runtime can commit
  authority batches without making Sophia Engine depend on Sophia X Authority.
- [x] Define the first runtime-owned backend assembly struct that holds output
  discovery, input polling, frame clock, authority transaction intake, and
  renderer selection without owning protocol policy.
- [x] Add a headless assembly smoke that drains authority batches into committed
  surface state and renders through the existing runtime driver.
- [x] Define the runtime event that reports authority process ready/degraded
  state without leaking X11 resource IDs or namespace metadata.
- [x] Move the Present-style smoke to the bounded X Authority transaction
  channel path; callback observers remain for focused tests.
- [x] Add a supervised X Authority process wrapper that emits reduced authority
  health observations.
- [x] Feed bounded authority transaction batches into the compositor backend
  assembly through a protocol-neutral inbox.
- [x] Decide the first real backend dependency boundary for DRM/KMS and
  libinput without changing the Engine/WM/Authority packet contracts.
- [x] Keep real DRM/KMS ioctls, GPU imports, and real MIT-SHM mapping deferred
  behind deterministic backend discovery and assembly seams.
- [x] Sketch the first live compositor backend crate boundary and keep kernel
  IO behind traits that preserve deterministic headless tests.
- [x] Pass `/usr/bin/xclock` against the Sophia X Authority socket through
  mapped exposure and observed Engine/Runtime authority transactions.
- [x] Add one smoke that proves backend discovery can fail closed without
  affecting protocol authority or WM IPC contracts.
- [x] Add a live backend dependency policy before adding crates that touch
  `/dev/dri`, `/dev/input`, GBM, EGL, DMA-BUF, or real MIT-SHM mapping.
- [x] Decide that libdrm and libinput may enter through
  `sophia-backend-live`, while GPU imports and real MIT-SHM mapping remain
  deferred until renderer import boundaries exist.
- [x] Define the renderer import boundary separately from backend discovery.
- [x] Sketch reduced renderer import admission records without adding GBM, EGL,
  DMA-BUF, or real MIT-SHM mapping.
- [x] Add deterministic tests for renderer import admission and fail-closed
  unsupported import paths.

  dedicated `sophia-renderer-live` crate once GBM, EGL, DMA-BUF, or explicit
  sync dependencies are required.

  GBM, EGL, DMA-BUF, or real MIT-SHM mapping.

  explicitly configured.

  import-capable, and degraded import capability.

  leaking renderer-private handles.

  DMA-BUF, or real MIT-SHM mapping.
- [x] Decide the first runtime observation shape for CPU fallback versus native
  import-capable renderer selection.
- [x] Decide that renderer import startup health is stored in the
  `sophia-backend-live` runtime wrapper, not inside `sophia-engine`.

  health is consumed by the runtime assembly.
- [x] Keep real GBM/EGL/DMA-BUF dependencies deferred until
  `sophia-renderer-live` has deterministic fake coverage.

  failure.
- [x] Decide that degraded renderer health is sourced from both failed startup
  capability probes and per-frame failed imports.
- [x] Add a fake failed-import path in `sophia-renderer-live` for per-frame
  degraded runtime observation.
- [x] Keep the live runtime wrapper outside `sophia-engine` unless engine-local
  renderer policy becomes unavoidable.

  source decision is documented.

  feature-gated GBM capability probe.

  so default offline deterministic tests remain available.

  adding the dependency.

  data before introducing a real crate.

  exists.

  not device-path intake or borrowed fd intake.

- [x] Add documented local check coverage for
  `cargo test --offline -p sophia-renderer-live --features gbm-probe`.

  adapter module rather than exposing it directly.

  default and feature-enabled paths.

  and path-free.

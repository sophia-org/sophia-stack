# Installed Sophia Operations

This is the operator runbook for an immutable Sophia release installed below
`/opt/sophia`. The ordinary desktop is the native Hagia WM plus Narthex shell.
Sophia does not package or run an unmodified legacy X11 WM as policy.

## Support Boundary

The retained physical reference is a Void Linux x86-64 host with an AMD Radeon
RX 7900 GRE (`amdgpu`), two DisplayPort outputs, and keyboard and pointer
devices on `seat0`. That identifies the proven combination; it is not a general
hardware promise.

An installed candidate requires:

- a local Linux virtual terminal supplied by greetd;
- an absolute, user-owned `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`;
- a working libseat provider and readable udev input discovery;
- atomic KMS plus GBM/Mesa, libdrm, libudev, libinput, and libxkbcommon;
- Bubblewrap 0.11.2 or newer at `/usr/bin/bwrap` for Hagia/Narthex;
- Bash, Python 3, GNU core utilities, procps, Kitty, Helium, and xterm.

X11 applications connect to Sophia's X Authority. Hagia connects directly to
`sophia_wm_v1`, and Narthex connects directly to `sophia_shell_v1`. These are
separate supervised protection domains. X Authority is not an X11 policy
environment and does not expose root-window WM authority.

## Installation And Session Entries

From a clean checkout at the commit to promote:

```sh
tools/install_live_session.sh
```

The command builds before requesting privilege, verifies every artifact digest,
installs a new immutable directory below `/opt/sophia/releases`, and atomically
updates `current` while retaining the former release as `previous`. Activation
and rollback validate the complete target surface before changing command links
or greetd entries.

A native-only schema-6 artifact records the Sophia commit and whether Hagia is
included. A Hagia artifact additionally records its signed source commit, the
canonical default-profile digest, and Hagia and Narthex executable digests.
Installation rejects missing, non-executable, or mismatched artifacts. Legacy
WM executables, compatibility configuration, and bridge fields are forbidden.

Every release installs these base entries:

- `Sophia Kitty (Baseline)` — one application, no WM or shell;
- `Sophia Native Chrome Proof` — a bounded Engine-chrome diagnostic.

A release built with explicit `SOPHIA_HAGIA_BIN` and
`SOPHIA_HAGIA_SHELL_BIN` paths also installs:

- `Sophia Hagia (Native Policy)` — the ordinary user-profile session;
- `Sophia Hagia Promotion (Packaged Default)` — immutable release evidence;
- `Sophia Firefox Proof` — the integrated browser workflow;
- `Sophia Recovery Proof` — a bounded watchdog/recovery gate.

The generic `sophia-session` command is an internal launcher and requires an
explicit native profile. It has no legacy-WM profile and no compatibility
fallback. Activating a native-only release removes stale Sophia-managed legacy
entries, but preserves unrelated files or links at the same paths.

## Status And Logs

From the session or an independent text VT:

```sh
sophia-status
```

Status verifies the current release checksums and reports current/previous
targets, relevant processes, lifecycle outcomes, runtime identity, and the
newest native proof attempts.

Durable user evidence lives below
`${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/sophia/`:

| Evidence | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Ordinary session identity, events, guard, recovery, lifecycle | `sessions/SESSION_ID/` |
| Current ordinary Hagia record | `hagia-session/current/` |
| Explicitly preserved diagnostic snapshots | `session-investigations/` |
| Kitty fallback session | `kitty-session/` |
| native diagnostics | `native-session/` |
| installed launch and runtime identity | `installed-session/` |
| Legacy Hagia attempts and explicit proof coverage | `promotion/hagia-runs/` |
| packaged-default Hagia attempts | `promotion/hagia-promotion-runs/` |
| Firefox, xterm, and TrueColor attempts | `promotion/{firefox,xterm,truecolor}-runs/` |
| fallback, emergency, watchdog, and native-chrome attempts | `promotion/{fallback,emergency,watchdog,native-chrome}-runs/` |

Legacy/proof log paths retain at most one `.previous` generation. Daily sessions
use the rolling history described below. Immutable proof attempts bind
the Sophia executable, relevant native policy executable, selected profile
identity, lifecycle, recovery, and reduced session evidence. Personal
configuration contents are never copied into an archive. Logs must not contain
typed text, clipboard data, window titles, or application content.

## Mark and investigate a problem

Installation exposes `sophia` in `/usr/local/bin`; it follows the selected
release through activation and rollback. On older installations that lack this
command, use `/opt/sophia/current/target/release/sophia` with the same arguments.

In an ordinary installed session, use a terminal or switch to another TTY and run:

```sh
sophia session mark "window stopped responding"
```

This command writes a local marker without asking the desktop to respond. It
selects the sole live session. If more than one session is live, select its ID
with `--session=ID`. After a crash, select the previous launch explicitly:

```sh
sophia session mark --session=latest "previous session crashed"
sophia session inspect latest
sophia session keep latest
```

The marker command prints the exact session and marker IDs and the command to
inspect that marker. `inspect ID --marker=MARKER_ID` shows events within sixty
seconds of either side of the marker, as far as retained evidence permits. A
marker written after the session ended is a report time, not an inferred crash
time; inspection shows the final retained minute. `sophia session list` lists
retained launches and storage totals. `sophia-status` includes that listing.

Each launch gets its own record before graphics takeover. Its manifest binds
Sophia's executable digest and installed release identity. The identity journal
records loaded core/desktop profile digests, WM profile activation, and the
executed WM and native-shell digests at each connection epoch. Hashing runs
separately from event recording; a pending or unavailable digest is not an
assertion about which executable ran. Component-private configuration remains
owned by its component and is reported as unobserved. File contents are not
copied, and editing a profile later does not change a recorded digest.

Events carry a write sequence, UTC milliseconds, boot-clock milliseconds, and
an approved Sophia record, separated by tabs. The manifest identifies the boot.
The boot clock permits correlation across wall-clock corrections. Identity
records may arrive after ordinary events; inspection orders events by their
observation time. Guard and TTY recovery records retain their existing schemas.
VT lifecycle fields and approved failure codes survive reduction. An
`unclassified` failure means the cause has no approved code; it does not imply
that the raw error was retained. Application content and arbitrary error text
remain excluded.

Ordinary logout reports lifecycle and cleanup success independently of X11
error replies. Those replies remain compatibility evidence in
`sophia_live_session_protocol_error_tally` schema 3: bounded major/minor/error
codes, retained counts, discarded observations, and a cumulative total. A
nonzero tally has status `compatibility_refusals`; it does not establish a
session failure or certify that the application worked. Explicit application
proofs still require zero unexpected protocol errors.

`sophia_session_failure` records the owning phase and an approved cause before
the session adds request-tally context to its error. Runtime failures retain
their original phase across cleanup. Check preceding runtime-fatal records
for typed causes that cleanup's contextual error may no longer carry. Missing
or `unclassified` causes require further investigation; successful TTY recovery
alone does not establish a successful session.

Quiescence schema 3 records `pending_control_count` on completion and timeout.
Successful shutdown requires that count to reach zero through acknowledgement
processing; frontend EOF alone does not settle commands issued by final layout
work. Queue, acknowledgement, and quiescence deadlines remain bounded.

Resource observations continue every five seconds throughout an ordinary
recorded session. Storage keeps four event segments of at most 15 MiB each,
with separate bounded identity and marker journals. Automatic history retains
at most twenty finished sessions within a 1 GiB budget, reserving space for the
active session's 64 MiB allowance. Active sessions are never deleted. If active
sessions alone exceed the budget, their protection takes precedence.

`keep ID` copies the evidence currently available into a private, checksummed
snapshot outside automatic pruning. A running-session snapshot records its
cutoff and is incomplete. Marking alone does not exempt a session from pruning;
keep the evidence when an investigation needs it. Preserved snapshots remain
until you remove them, and their storage total is reported separately. Existing
archives are not migrated or pruned.

Recording uses bounded queues and synchronizes periodically. Its health record
reports discarded records, rotated bytes, storage failures, and the last
confirmed synchronization time. An abrupt power loss can lose the newest
unsynchronized tail. An unfinished record with no live owner is `interrupted`;
Sophia does not invent an exit code or crash cause. A clean process exit is
`exited`, a nonzero exit is `failed`, and neither is a proof verdict.

Daily capture accepts Sophia's structured evidence, not mixed application
stdout/stderr. Sensitive fields and arbitrary strings are excluded. Labels are
operator-supplied local notes, limited to 256 UTF-8 bytes without control
characters. Session directories require mode 0700 and files mode 0600; unsafe
owners and links are refused. The ownership manifest contains the minimal host
process/boot identity needed to distinguish a live wrapper from PID reuse;
`inspect` does not print that private control identity. No new scripting socket,
namespace grant, WM metadata, tracing, or pixel capture is enabled.

Diagnostic failure is reported without replacing the ordinary session's exit
status. Explicit proof/promotion workflows retain their exact evidence and
strict verifiers. For a recorded daily session, use `inspect`; to verify a
legacy Hagia archive, pass its directory explicitly to `sophia-verify-hagia`.

## Normal Stop

Use `Ctrl+Alt+Delete` for ordinary Hagia logout. A customized profile may choose
another nonreserved binding. Normal logout commits the policy action, drains
presentation and application ownership, restores the VT, and returns to greetd.

If the graphical session cannot accept the shortcut, use an independent text
VT as the same user:

```sh
sophia-stop
```

The command signals the outer session wrapper. Do not kill Sophia, Hagia,
Narthex, Kitty, or Firefox individually; that bypasses the owner responsible
for bounded cleanup. `sophia-stop hagia` remains available when an explicit
profile is useful.

## Emergency Recovery And Fallback

The independent input guard is armed before graphics takeover. If both
rendering and routed input are unusable, press and release
`Ctrl+Alt+Backspace`. The guard does not depend on Sophia, Hagia, or Narthex. It
ends the supervised process group, restores keyboard/KD/termios state, and
returns control to greetd.

After greetd returns:

1. Select `Sophia Kitty (Baseline)` to isolate the core display/input path.
2. Exit Kitty normally.
3. Run `sophia-verify-fallback` from a text VT.
4. Inspect `sophia-status` before retrying Hagia.

`Sophia Recovery Proof` exercises the process-external watchdog. Verify its
latest archive with `sophia-verify-watchdog`. An independent emergency chord
from a Hagia session is archived separately and verified with
`sophia-verify-emergency`.

## Rollback

From an independent text VT after the current session has ended:

```sh
sophia-status
sudo sophia-rollback
sophia-status
```

Rollback swaps `current` and `previous`; it does not edit either immutable
release. A second invocation swaps the same pair back.

## Native Evidence Workflows

Explicit proof and promotion sessions reserve an immutable attempt before
graphics takeover. Verified normal logout records `status=passed`, emergency
recovery records `status=recovered`, unexpected exits record `status=failed`,
and interruption before finalization leaves `status=pending`. Ordinary daily
sessions use the diagnostic history above.

Verify retained legacy and packaged-default proof sessions with:

```sh
sophia-verify-hagia /absolute/path/to/legacy/archive
sophia-verify-hagia-promotion
```

Focused X11-application proofs remain commands rather than desktop policy
profiles:

```sh
sophia-xterm-proof
sophia-verify-xterm-runs 1

sophia-truecolor-proof
sophia-verify-truecolor-runs 1
```

Both run under Hagia/Narthex. The xterm proof covers CPU-backed placement,
work-area reservation, VT switch/resume, page-flip retirement, and clean
logout. The TrueColor proof covers core color requests, CPU and DMA-BUF
composition, independent output readiness, retirement, and exact recovery.

`Sophia Native Chrome Proof` records the ordered ring/frame sequence and is
verified with `sophia-verify-native-chrome`. Firefox proof attempts are checked
with `sophia-verify-firefox-runs`.

There is no installed cycle or two-hour soak gate. Long durability runs are
optional overnight diagnostics and do not block product work. Historical
bridge-era evidence remains in the Git history and roadmap archives; it is not
installed, re-executed, or accepted as current native-policy evidence.

## Known Limitations

- Sophia is a native X11 application-server candidate, not a full Xorg
  replacement. Compatibility is limited to the admitted operations in the X11
  matrix.
- Wayland application protocol support is intentionally absent.
- Only the retained AMD reference has physical daily-driver evidence; other
  drivers, topologies, and architectures remain unproven.
- Applications that require a desktop portal, notification service, or
  accessibility bus are outside the current support boundary.
- Only one previous release is addressable through rollback. Preserve older
  immutable release directories until a successor has clean Hagia/Narthex and
  recovery evidence.

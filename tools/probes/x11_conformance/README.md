# Independent X11 socket conformance gate

Run from this checkout:

```sh
python3 -B tools/probes/x11_conformance/check.py --output /tmp/sophia-x11-results
```

The evidence directory must be new. The command runs gate regressions, builds
the software-only `x11_conformance_host`, then runs every mandatory case in
both byte orders. `--target-dir /absolute/build-cache` selects a build cache.
Python, the offline Rust dependencies and the normal X-authority build
dependencies are required. Private Unix socket creation must be permitted.
Socket denial is a launch failure, not protocol evidence.

For comparisons across archived sources or when build freshness is in doubt,
pass a new, previously unused `--target-dir` for each candidate. Keep both reports;
do not infer a candidate's identity from a shared cached executable. The report
records the actual host digest and source identity, and marks dirty checkouts.

No Sophia session, renderer, DRM device, input device, VT, installation or
operator display is used. The runner clears inherited `SOPHIA_*`, `HAGIA_*`,
display endpoints and `PYTHONOPTIMIZE`. It creates a new mode-0700 temporary
directory and starts the production `XServerFrontend` with its real routed
broker and concurrent workers there. There is deliberately no public option
to attach the gate to an existing display. The test namespace is ClassicShared;
this gate does not certify confined namespace separation or Session policy.

The host has deterministic software output facts and no render-device provider.
DRI3 is therefore expected to be unadvertised. This fixture limitation is
distinct from the deliberate Composite/DAMAGE/XTEST/DPMS exclusions and from
missing implementations of mandatory protocol requests.

## Independent assertions and mandatory accounting

`wire.py` implements client framing directly from the
[X11 protocol specification](https://xorg.freedesktop.org/archive/X11R7.7/doc/xproto/x11protocol.html).
It imports no Sophia encoders, decoders, constants or generated bindings.
`cases.py` observes replies, error sequences/resources, subscribed events,
cross-client property/selection effects, grab contention and cleanup. GetInputFocus
round trips establish request ordering; a successful write is never a barrier.
Each case has an absolute socket deadline, record/backlog limits and an outer
client-process deadline. Progress or unrelated events do not reset the deadline.
Only process groups created by the runner are terminated.

Setup containment cases cover EOF before any bytes, each truncated prefix
length, truncation throughout padded authorization fields, an invalid byte-order
marker, and an unsupported major version. After each rejected connection, an
existing client's window must survive and a new client must complete setup and
query it. Both byte orders run. These cases certify containment, not complete
version-negotiation refusal semantics. The host polls and reaps workers without
waiting for another connection, so an idle blocking accept cannot hide a fatal
worker result. No preflight ever connects to an existing display.

Lifecycle cases distinguish explicit DestroyWindow from owner disconnect. They
check descendant event order, both StructureNotify/SubstructureNotify addresses,
no-mask suppression, stale subscriptions after XID reuse, and automatic unmap
before mapped destruction. DestroySubwindows is tested with empty/invalid targets
and with newer siblings restacked below older ones; allocation order cannot
accidentally satisfy the stacking assertion. Each behavior has its own mandatory
case so a passing notification-presence check cannot hide an ordering failure.

`manifest.json` binds the mandatory profile to cases, core request numbers and
extension obligations. Every required case must produce exactly one PASS per
byte order. Missing, duplicate, unexecuted, unknown, malformed, NORESULT,
UNSUPPORTED, UNTESTED and timeout results fail. A PASS with a failing process
exit also fails. There are no XFAIL baselines or automatic skip-to-pass paths.
Python `-O` is rejected so assertions cannot silently disappear.

The source declaration inventory is a separate coverage audit, not an oracle
for wire behavior. Every currently decoded core request has either named cases
or explicit coverage debt. A new decoder arm missing from the inventory fails
the audit. Coverage debt is reported, not counted as tested. The selected gate
does not claim all core requests, every extension operation, actual input
delivery, GPU behavior, or the native protocol-family t023 exit. Add independently
specified cases when expanding those obligations; do not regenerate expected
behavior from Sophia replies.

`report.json` retains complete verdicts, scope, coverage debt, host digest,
harness/manifest digests, source commit and dirty-state flag. A source commit
alone does not identify a dirty build. Host logs are per case. During development,
changes between a build and a run require rebuilding; preserve the report with
its actual binary hash. A run on an older candidate remains older evidence.

XFixes selection obligations also exercise reasserted and rapidly changing
owners, explicit clear, replacement/zero masks, invalid subscription requests,
window destruction versus client close, subscription retirement on XID reuse,
and same-client delivery. Assertions cover the recipient sequence and resolved
CurrentTime fields. The semantics are checked against XFixes selection tracking
in [fixesproto](https://github.com/X11Libre/mirror.fdo.xorgproto/blob/master/fixesproto.txt)
and the local XLibre `Xext/xfixes/select.c` and `dix/selection.c`; no implementation
code is copied. This software fixture still does not certify namespace policy.

## Optional selected XTS5 adapter

XTS is a separate checkout/build; the yserver checkout does not supply it.
Once it is available, prepare a selected scenario in that checkout and a JSON
array of its exact mandatory purpose identities:

```json
[{"case":"/ACTUAL/BUILT/CASE/PATH","purpose":1}]
```

Use actual paths and purpose IDs from that XTS build. The example above is a
schema illustration, not a real selection or a passing baseline. Select the
window/property/focus requests supported by the software fixture; requests
requiring real devices do not belong in this adapter's acceptance profile.

```sh
python3 -B tools/probes/x11_conformance/xts.py \
  --host .artifacts/x11-conformance-target/debug/examples/x11_conformance_host \
  --xts-root /absolute/separate/xts \
  --scenario selected-core \
  --expected /absolute/selected-purposes.json \
  --output /tmp/sophia-selected-xts
```

The adapter requires the separate checkout's `check.sh`, built `xts5` directory,
executable TET `tcc`, bubblewrap, the exact selected-purpose manifest and the
selected scenario. It copies the external tree privately, excludes old results
and `tetexec.cfg`, then runs with a private `/tmp/.X11-unix/X99`, network namespace
and `/dev`. An old wrapper hardcoding a host display cannot reach that display.
The original XTS tree is not modified. The host/harness are copied inside the
private filesystem so an isolated worktree under `/tmp` remains usable.

Exactly one fresh journal is required. Every declared mandatory purpose must
start and finish PASS. The numeric TET verdict must agree with its text;
duplicate/unstarted records fail. Process failure/timeout fails even when a
partial journal contains PASS results. This deliberately rejects the yserver
comparator's PASS-to-NORESULT and missing-candidate-purpose false positives.
No results from an older directory can supply a pass.

With missing dependencies the adapter writes `BLOCKED`, `suite_executed=false`
and concrete missing paths/tools, and exits 2. This host currently has no XTS
checkout at `~/src/xts`, no built suite there and no TET `tcc` on PATH. No actual
XTS5 scenario has been run. Synthetic TET fixtures test adapter isolation and
reporting only; they are not XTS evidence.

## Gate regressions and references

```sh
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s tools/probes/x11_conformance -p test_gate.py -v
```

These include absent/empty results, NORESULT, unsupported/untested statuses,
duplicates, nonexistent mandatory cases, process timeouts despite continuing
output, optimized-Python refusal, extension inventory drift and strict TET
purpose accounting. The real socket run is separate and can correctly fail
while all gate-regression tests pass.

Reviewed external references: `~/src/yserver/tools/xts-run.sh`,
`xts-vs-baseline.py`, `fontset-probe.c`, `xid-exhaust-probe.c`; and XLibre's
`~/src/xserver/test/pyxtest` and `test/xi2`. XLibre's raw-protocol tests and
swapped-byte-order tests are useful models. Its default Xvfb/Xorg launchers and
live-display option are not used here. No external implementation code was copied.

See the [investigation](../../../docs/notes/investigations/wzxlxbok-independent-x11-socket-conformance-exposes-missing-client-completions.md)
for candidate-specific failures and linked repair tasks. The gate must remain
red until those mandatory behaviors work; it does not establish a pinentry cause.

The XFixes stalled-watcher case leaves one subscriber unread while generating
4,096 bounded ownership assertions. A second subscriber must receive every
notification, the stalled socket must close, and both the sender and fresh
admission must remain usable. A live socket with silently lost notifications
fails by deadline. This pressure check does not certify every routed event
family; older destroy/MSC recipient handling is tracked separately as t090.

The mixed-owner descendant case closes a parent client while another client owns
its child and a separate selection. It requires actual child destruction,
client-close subtype 2 for the parent, window-destroy subtype 1 for the child,
retained ownership timestamps and continued service for the surviving peer.


## Canonical workspace checks without hardware access

Use the contained wrapper for an offline `cargo xtask check`. Clearing
`SOPHIA_*` and `HAGIA_*` is insufficient: parts of the canonical gate also
probe writable render nodes automatically. The wrapper supplies a private
`/dev` without DRM or input devices, clears the environment, and closes
unrelated descriptors before starting the unchanged canonical command.

```sh
python3 -B tools/probes/x11_conformance/offline_check.py \
  --source /absolute/clean-checkout \
  --target-dir /absolute/main-checkout/.artifacts/offline-target \
  --output /absolute/main-checkout/.artifacts/offline-check-new
```

Both output and target must be distinct, disk-backed children of the main
checkout's `.artifacts`; build targets under `/tmp` are refused. The source
must be clean and committed. The wrapper copies the exact commit into an
independent repository, records its tree/archive hash and toolchain hashes,
and mounts only the offline registry cache from Cargo home. It generates a
loopback-only `/etc/hosts` for regular-file refusal tests, generates its loader
cache from the allowlisted libraries, and links the private source copy's `target` to the explicitly owned target directory for profile
binary discovery. These fixtures expose neither an installed Sophia nor host `/etc`. The exact
`rg` executable is mounted separately and hashed; compiler and required helper
versions are checked before the workspace suite, so a missing helper cannot be
mistaken for source-layout evidence.

`--validate-only` checks tool versions and offline Cargo metadata without
building or running the workspace gate. Reports distinguish that from an
invoked full check. A failed invocation remains failed; hardware proofs and
host promoted archives remain unrun inside this environment. This command
cannot establish physical-input or display acceptance.

Wrapper regression commands (no full workspace check):

```sh
python3 -B -W error -m unittest discover -s tools/probes/x11_conformance -p test_offline_check.py
python3 -B tools/probes/x11_conformance/test_isolation.py
```

The second command requires working unprivileged namespaces and fails when they
are unavailable. Its socket endpoints and inherited descriptors are fabricated
by the tests; it never probes the operator's display or service endpoints.
